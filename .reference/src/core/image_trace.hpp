// Raster-to-vector tracing (Trace Image to Shapes): quantize a pixel layer to
// a few colors, walk the boundary of every color region, and fit the contours
// into bezier subpaths. Output is one compound path per color (or per color
// and nesting depth), ready to become shape layers.
//
// The pipeline is built from published, long-expired techniques: median-cut
// quantization (Heckbert 1982) refined by fixed-iteration integer Lloyd
// k-means (Lloyd 1957/1982), exact optimal scalar quantization for grayscale
// (Bruce 1965 / Lloyd-Max), box-blur pre-smoothing and 3x3 label majority
// filtering (classic image processing), connected-component speckle removal,
// the selection-outline boundary walk, Douglas-Peucker (1973) and Schneider
// (1990) fitting in core/path_fit. Every stage is integer or deterministic
// double math with fixed tie-breaks (the cross-toolchain rule), including the
// parallel stages: workers only fill disjoint position-indexed slots, so the
// output is bit-identical to a sequential run.
//
// Legal boundary (docs/legal-constraints.md, "Vector tracing"): tracing runs
// ONCE on explicit request into static shape layers. Never attach a live
// re-tracing link between the source layer and its traced result, never vary
// parameters per region, and never derive a path from two user-picked edge
// points. Centerline (stroke) tracing is not implemented.
