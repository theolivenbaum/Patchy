// Spot Healing / Remove Object source geometry: ONE coherent rigid mapping for
// the whole footprint (a brush stroke or a selection), chosen from the mask's
// SHAPE alone. The footprint is reflected across the line just past its
// nearest boundary (or translated clear of itself when the reflection would
// land back inside), so the sampled texture stays spatially coherent instead
// of smearing per pixel. Candidate directions are tried in a FIXED order with
// mask-geometry validity counts; pixel content is never read here. The only
// other input is `attempt`, the user's repeat count, which walks the
// geometrically valid candidates in their fixed order. Any content-driven
// source search added later must be the exhaustive exemplar search that
// docs/legal-constraints.md clears ("Content-aware fill and exemplar
// inpainting"), never PatchMatch-style offset propagation or perturbation
// (Adobe US 8285055 / US 8340463 / US 8355592, into 2031). The tone blend on
// top is the classic healing membrane of the expired US 6587592
// (core/heal_membrane.hpp). See docs/legal-constraints.md before changing
// anything here.
