// Deterministic scanline rasterizer for vector paths (fills; the stroker
// builds on it). Inputs are quantized once to 24.8 fixed point, and every
// coverage computation after that is integer-only, so output is bit-identical
// across toolchains (the cross-platform determinism rule). Anti-aliasing is
// exact-area cell coverage (the FreeType-smooth family, reimplemented from
// the algorithm idea with Patchy's own conventions).
//
// Semantics pinned against Photoshop 27.8 (docs/vector-tools.md):
// - subpaths sharing a shape_group rasterize together under EVEN-ODD winding;
// - groups combine sequentially by their op over accumulated coverage
//   (soft-boolean: add/union, subtract, intersect, xor);
// - a first group with op Subtract starts from a fully-covered canvas; any
//   other first op yields exactly the group's own coverage;
// - open subpaths fill their implied closing chord;
// - an EMPTY path means "cover everything" (fill layers without a mask).
