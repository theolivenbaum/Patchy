// The Windows UI-font choice, split out of main.cpp so the rule below is testable.
//
// THE RULE: never register a font FILE for a family Windows already installs. An
// application font's engine carries no file name in its QFontEngine::FaceId, and
// QPdfEngine embeds a font only when it has one; for an application font it silently
// falls back to drawing every glyph as a filled path, so an editable PDF export loses all
// its text for that family (it re-imports as shape layers). Patchy registered
// C:/Windows/Fonts/{arial,segoeui,calibri}*.ttf unconditionally until August 2026, which
// is exactly what happened to Segoe UI text. See docs/fonts.md.
struct UiFontCandidate {
  QString family;
  QStringList files;  // the files that provide the family where Windows lacks it
};

// Preference order: Arial, Segoe UI, Calibri.
[[nodiscard]] std::vector<UiFontCandidate> windows_ui_font_candidates();

// The first candidate family present in `installed_families`, or an empty string when
// none is installed.
[[nodiscard]] QString installed_ui_font_family(const QStringList& installed_families);

// The bundled CJK families, ordered so the active UI language's own glyph shapes win
// (wasm only; every other platform has system fonts and Qt's own fallback).
//
// THE RULE: Japanese, Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese share most Han
// codepoints, and Qt's per-glyph fallback takes the FIRST family in the list that has
// the glyph. Korean leads with NanumGothic; other languages append it for Hangul.
// An order that ignores the UI language renders, say, a Simplified sentence
// in Japanese shapes with only the Simplified-only characters in Chinese shapes, which
// is worse than either alone. `language_code` is a LocalizationManager catalog code.
[[nodiscard]] QStringList wasm_cjk_fallback_families(const QString& language_code);

// The files to register as application fonts: empty whenever a candidate family is
// already installed (the normal case), and only the fallback family's files when none
// is, where an outlined PDF export beats having no UI font at all.
