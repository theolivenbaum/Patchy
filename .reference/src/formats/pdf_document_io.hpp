// Reads a PDF page into an editable Patchy document: paths become shape layers,
// text-showing operators become text layers, and images become smart objects.
// Qt-free, like the SVG and Affinity readers it follows.
//
// Two things are finished on the Qt side, because they need font and image
// machinery this library deliberately does not link:
//   - text layers carry patchy.text.* metadata plus kLayerMetadataPdfPendingText,
//     rendered by MainWindow::render_pending_pdf_text_layers;
//   - image layers carry their bytes in the document's SmartObjectStore plus
//     kLayerMetadataPdfPendingImage, rendered by MainWindow::render_pending_pdf_images.
//
// The rasterizing importer in src/ui/pdf_import.* is the other half of the feature:
// this one keeps structure, that one keeps fidelity, and the Import PDF dialog
// chooses. Anything this reader cannot model is reported through `notices` so the
// caller can offer the raster path instead.
