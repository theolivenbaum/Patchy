"""Krita driver: headless export through Krita's own Python scripting.

`kritarunner -s testy_krita_export -f main <in> <out> <report>` runs
drivers/krita_scripts/testy_krita_export.py inside Krita: open, wait until the image
has settled, export (format by extension: PNG render, PSD resave). The plain CLI
(`krita.com <in> --export --export-filename <out>`) writes the file as soon as the
document is loaded, before fill and vector layers are drawn, so the same PSD came out
drawn on one run and blank on the next; it remains only as the fallback for a file
the script route cannot finish.

One kind of run-to-run variation survives the wait: Krita resolves a text layer's
font differently from one launch to the next (the right face on one, a fallback on
another). That is Krita's behavior, not the harness's, so a PNG render is made twice
and, when the two differ, a third time; the picture that came out most often is the
one kept, and the result says the renders varied.

Neither console shim prints anything through pipes on this machine, so success is
judged by the script's report file, or for the CLI by exit code plus output existence.
