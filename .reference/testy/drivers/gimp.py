"""GIMP driver: headless Script-Fu batch through gimp-console-3.exe.

GIMP 3 refuses batch work without an explicit --batch-interpreter, and a batch
command that errors makes the console STOP at the failing command without ever
reaching the trailing (gimp-quit 0) batch, leaving the process alive forever.
The script therefore wraps its whole body in Script-Fu's catch, whose handler
only runs on error, so the quit batch always executes and the process exits 0
either way; success is judged by output existence, and the GIMP-Error lines
naming the real cause reach stderr whether or not the error was caught.
gimp-file-save picks the format from the extension (PNG render, PSD resave)
and merges layers itself for flat formats, keeping alpha, so the render leg
needs no explicit flatten (Testy composites over white during analysis).
