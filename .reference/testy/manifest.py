"""Structural manifest comparison: how many objects survived a resave natively.

Both manifests come from Photoshop reopening the file (drivers/photoshop.py), so
"native" means "Photoshop still recognizes the object as what it was" - text still
a type layer, a curves adjustment still curves, a smart object still smart, live
effects still live. Matching pairs layers by name sequence (difflib) because
editors renumber, drop, and occasionally rename layers.
