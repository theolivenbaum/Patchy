"""Testy: PSD compatibility benchmark across the editors installed on this machine.

Photoshop is ground truth. For every corpus PSD and every editor, Testy measures:
opening, honest rendering accuracy (with a sentinel-composite trap against baked
flat previews), native object preservation after a resave (checked by reopening
the editor's PSD in Photoshop), the round-trip render, and a forced text
re-render where the editor is scriptable. A live browser dashboard shows the
matrix filling in; results persist per run for over-time comparison.

Run with any Python 3.11+ that has the packages from testy/requirements.txt
(machine settings live in testy/config.local.json; see config.example.json):
  python testy\\testy.py [options]
See docs/testy.md.

# the same way would be misjudged. For those two kinds a blank layer counts against
