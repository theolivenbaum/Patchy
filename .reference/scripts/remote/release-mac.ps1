<#
Builds the distributable macOS dmg from the current working tree and copies it into
build\package\ next to the Windows artifacts.

  scripts\remote\release-mac.ps1

Flow: snapshot + remote mac-release build (scripts\remote\remote-build.ps1 -SkipTests),
then packaging/macos/make-dmg.sh on the mac build host (macdeployqt -> codesign -> dmg ->
notarize -> staple -> verify), then scp the dmg back.

PATCHY_REQUIRE_SIGNING=1 is passed so make-dmg.sh treats a missing signing identity or
notary profile as a hard error instead of quietly producing an unsigned dmg, and proves
the finished artifact with stapler validate + spctl. This script builds what gets
published, so an unsigned result is a failure, not a fallback (see
packaging/macos/README.md). It also runs -SkipTests: run the full suites separately
(scripts\remote\remote-build.ps1 -Target mac) before publishing, as AGENTS.md requires.
