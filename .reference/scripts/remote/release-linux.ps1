<#
Builds the distributable Linux Flatpak bundle and the signed Flatpak repository from the
current working tree and copies both into build\package\ next to the Windows artifacts.

  scripts\remote\release-linux.ps1

Flow: snapshot push (scripts\remote\remote-build.ps1 -SkipTests validates the tree
still builds against the aqt Qt), then packaging/linux/make-flatpak.sh on the linux build host
(flatpak-builder against the org.kde.Platform runtime -> signed repository -> flatpak
build-bundle), then scp the bundle and the repository tar back. One-time build-host setup
is in the make-flatpak.sh header (flatpak/flatpak-builder via apt) and in
packaging/linux/README.md (the repository signing key, named in ~/.patchy-release-env).

PATCHY_REQUIRE_FLATPAK_REPO=1 is passed so make-flatpak.sh treats a missing signing key as
a hard error: a release bundle built without the repository would install fine and then
never update.
