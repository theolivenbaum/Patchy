// Patchy scripting API type definitions (API version 1).
//
// Reference for editors (VS Code autocomplete) and for AI agents driving
// Patchy through `patchy --run-script`. Scripts are plain JavaScript run by
// Patchy's embedded engine (ES6-level); this file is documentation, it is
// never executed. The human-readable companion is scripting-guide.md next to
// this file (Help in the Script Manager opens it).
//
// Script header directives (read by the Script Manager and File > Scripts
// menu from the comment block at the top of a .js file; parsing stops at the
// first non-comment line):
//   // @name Breakout        display name shown instead of the file name
//   // @description ...      hover-card blurb (repeat the line to continue it)
//   // @author Jane Doe      hover-card credit line
//   // @window               the script creates its own window or document
//                            (shown as a window badge; scripts without it
//                            work on the active document)
//   // @cli ...              the argument part of the script's command-line
//                            example, everything after "--run-script <script>"
//                            (repeat the line to continue it). Shown by the
//                            Script Manager's C:\ button; without it the
//                            example falls back to an "example.png"
//                            placeholder for active-document scripts.
// A 128x128 PNG next to the script with the same base name (breakout.js ->
// breakout.png) becomes its icon; right-click a script in the Script Manager
// for "Set Icon from Current Window".
//
// Convention: keep the tweakable defaults in an OPTIONS object at the top of
// the script and pass them through patchy.ui.showOptions, which handles the
// options dialog, --script-arg overrides, and unattended runs in one call.
//
// Long-running scripts: there is NO runtime limit - a batch job may run for
// hours. The watchdog only stops a script that shows no sign of life (no
// pixel write, file operation, or console output) for 2 minutes, so log
// progress periodically inside heavy pure-JS computations. GUI runs longer
// than half a second show a busy overlay and a Stop panel automatically.
//
// Color strings use Qt order: "#rrggbb", "#aarrggbb", or named ("red").
// Blend mode ids: "pass-through", "normal", "dissolve", "multiply", "screen", "overlay",
// "darken", "lighten", "color-dodge", "color-burn", "hard-light",
// "soft-light", "difference", "linear-burn", "pin-light", "saturation",
// "luminosity", "exclusion", "hue", "color", "linear-dodge", "subtract",
// "divide", "vivid-light", "linear-light", "hard-mix", "darker-color",
// "lighter-color".
