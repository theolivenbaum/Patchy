# Code organization and translation-unit ownership

Read this before moving functions, adding members to the large UI classes, splitting translation units, or doing broad refactors. Keep moves pure: moving a function between files must not change its body. Helpers belong in one place; never copy a helper when promoting it for cross-TU use.

## MainWindow

Vector-preserving merge planning, output preparation, and its dialog live in `ui/layer_merge.{hpp,cpp}`; `MainWindow::merge_down` retains command selection and the internal text-render callback. See [layer-merging.md](layer-merging.md).

`MainWindow` is one class declared in `src/ui/main_window.hpp`, with its implementation split by area:

- `main_window_chrome.cpp` - frameless-window machinery, `configure_window_chrome()`, and `use_custom_window_chrome()`.
- `main_window_palette.cpp` - palette-mode mutations, palette file I/O, panel/chip refresh, and compliance scanning.
- `main_window_adjustments.cpp` - adjustment-layer creation, editing, previews, and the destructive posterize/threshold/brightness-contrast appliers. The four `apply_levels/curves/hue_saturation/color_balance_adjustment` members live here because their primary callers are the `new_*_adjustment_layer` flows; the destructive dialogs call across TUs through `main_window.hpp`.
- `main_window_filters.cpp` - Smart Filter creation/editing/stack operations, the destructive Filter-menu `apply_filter` flow, Liquify, and the Filter Gallery, including the gallery's cancellable preview state machine.
- `main_window_destructive_adjustments.cpp` - the destructive Levels, Curves, Hue/Saturation, and Color Balance dialog flows, driven by the shared async pixel-preview launcher in `main_window_shared`.
- `main_window_actions.cpp` - the `create_actions()` orchestrator, translation binding, and retranslation machinery. The phase builders live in `main_window_actions_menus.cpp` (menu bar), `main_window_actions_tool_palette.cpp` (tool palette, `add_tool_action`, tool icons), and `main_window_actions_options_bar.cpp` (options bar, `FlowLayout`, option-bar widgets). Cross-phase state travels through `ActionBuildContext` in `main_window_actions_internal.hpp`, which no TU outside `main_window_actions*.cpp` may include; the context dies when `create_actions()` returns, so lambdas must never capture it. Construction order is the contract: menus, tool palette, options bar, translation binding, final refresh, and retranslation callbacks run in registration order.
- `main_window_layer_ops.cpp` - clipboard operations, transform/warp dialogs, layer/folder operations, masks, layer styles and context menu, delete/move, merge-visible, fill/clear/stroke, selection geometry, flips, crop-to-selection, and canvas rotation. `rasterize_active_layers`, `rasterize_active_layer_styles`, and `merge_down` stay in `main_window.cpp` because they render text through the internal text pipeline.
- `main_window_tool_options.cpp` - preset-library accessors, brush-tip import/define, per-layer controls, colors and gradients, tool activation/settings, transform-session controls, options-bar registration, selection-mode buttons, and brush-control synchronization. `current_text_color` and `sync_text_options_from_active_editor` stay in `main_window.cpp` because they use internal text helpers.
- `main_window_theme.cpp` - `photoshop_style()` and application-wide QSS, declared in `main_window_shared.hpp`.
- `main_window_plugins.cpp` - legacy Photoshop plug-in folder scanning, the category submenu, and running a plug-in through the out-of-process host (`legacy_plugin_runner_win.cpp`); see docs/plugins.md.
- `main_window_layer_panel.cpp` - layer-row widgets, thumbnails, summaries, refresh, drag, and visibility plumbing.
- `main_window_files.cpp` - the single `file_format_entries()` definition, open/save/export/print/import, and recent files/folders.
- `main_window_smart_objects.cpp` - smart-object export, commit, refresh, relink, embed, replace, convert, and place flows.
- `main_window_sessions.cpp` - document sessions, tabs, close paths, float windows, and `update_start_panel_visibility()`.
- `main_window_preferences.cpp` - Preferences, guides, and pen/view settings.
- `main_window_document_dialogs.cpp` - Image Size/Canvas Size and resize/reset members. The New Document dialog lives in `src/ui/new_document_dialog.cpp`; its preset ids and `newDocument/` keys (`lastPresetId`, `lastWidth`, `lastHeight`, `lastPpi`, `lastBackground`, `lastUnit`, `lastResolutionUnit`) are persisted and append-only. Screen presets and `reset_document` default to 72 PPI; print presets use 300 PPI.
- `main_window_docks.cpp` - dock creation and right-dock resize handles.
- `main_window_history.cpp` - undo/redo, snapshots, selection history, and history-panel refresh.
- `main_window_vector.cpp` - shape/fill layers, vector masks, work-path operations, and the shape-appearance preview.
- `main_window_channels.cpp` - document channels, alpha channels, Quick Mask, and channel-panel refresh.
- `main_window_paths.cpp` - the Paths panel, path thumbnails, and path/selection conversions.
- `main_window_scripting.cpp` - the Scripts menu, script editor, and CLI script execution.
- `main_window_stress_test.cpp` - the stress-test runner and its CLI entry points.
- `main_window_shared.{hpp,cpp}` - helpers used by more than one MainWindow TU, including the async pixel-preview state/launcher and the progress-dialog filter-progress adapter.

Per-file helpers stay in an anonymous namespace. When a second TU needs one, move it to `main_window_shared`, declare it in the header, and remove the old definition. A duplicated helper with a static local forks its state; an extern declaration beside a same-name anonymous-namespace definition makes calls ambiguous. The split TUs deliberately repeat `main_window.cpp`'s complete include block.

`main_window.cpp` keeps the constructor and event/input plumbing, `configure_canvas`, the text tool and render pipeline, text-dependent rasterize/merge operations, registration helpers, `PreviewDialogEditLock`, and document-action-state machinery. Do not move the rest of the text tool as a simple split: it requires designed modules with their own interfaces. The first of those exists: `ui/text_layout.{hpp,cpp}` owns the line-layout plan (the Photoshop leading model, the boxed line gate, the OS/2 typographic ascent) plus `TextLineGeometry`, the single authority for caret, selection and hit-test geometry. Anything that needs to know where a character sits goes through it; see [text-tool.md](text-tool.md). The document construction and raster pass stay in `main_window.cpp` for now because `build_text_render_document` pulls in the whole font-resolution and run-application helper set. The three text-settings-from-editor variants also stay here; their differences are real.

### Session lifetime and startup

Startup creates no document. The start panel in `src/ui/start_panel.cpp` overlays `document_tabs_` only while `sessions_` is empty. `load_tool_settings()` runs once when the first document session is added because it needs a canvas. `MainWindow::begin_startup_update_check` is called only from `src/app/main.cpp`, so tests do not start network requests. `show_window` supplies the historical test document; use `show_window_empty` for real empty-workspace behavior.

`add_document_session` initializes history and hides the start panel before adding
the tab with signals blocked, then explicitly calls `activate_document_canvas`
once. That activation owns the initial panel refresh; file-open callers must not
repeat it after fitting the view. `SessionActivation::Background` (the pages of a
multi-page PDF after the first) stops after publishing the session: no tab switch and
no activation, so the active document is untouched, and the session fits its view on
its first activation instead. Row-build progress and its edit guard are
documented in [performance.md](performance.md).

Session data must outlive canvas event delivery. `~MainWindow` detaches every canvas with `set_document(nullptr)` before member destruction frees Documents. `close_document_session` destroys the canvas before erasing the session because QWidget destruction can deliver focus-out events to child widgets. Preserve both orders. References into `SmartObjectStore` do not survive `add_embedded`.

## CanvasWidget

`canvas_widget_vector_preview.cpp` owns the optional vector view's worker/cache lifecycle;
`vector_preview_renderer.{hpp,cpp}` owns its scene and tiled renderer. See [vector-preview.md](vector-preview.md).
`render/raster_view_context.hpp` scopes full paint bounds and transient style-mask
behavior to a viewport renderer's compositor call; normal renders have no context.

`CanvasWidget` is split into `canvas_widget_*.cpp` files for events, render, view, guides, selection, selection engines, brush, draw tools, transform, move, pen, vector tools, and cursors. Free transform and warp remain together in `canvas_widget_transform.cpp` because they share pending-session state. Promote cross-TU helpers to `canvas_widget_shared.{hpp,cpp}`.

`canvas_widget.cpp` keeps construction, document lifecycle, setters, smart-filter-mask targeting, callback plumbing, and picking helpers. Patent-constraint comments for Quick Select solve-on-release and Magnetic Lasso finish-time region construction stay verbatim with their functions in `canvas_widget_selection_engines.cpp`.

## PSD codec

The PSD codec uses one TU per block family: `psd_channel_data`, `psd_image_resources`, `psd_adjustments`, `psd_layer_styles`, `psd_text_read`, `psd_text_write`, `psd_text_legacy` (the PS 5.x `tySh` record), `psd_layer_records`, `psd_smart_objects`, `psd_vector`, `psd_filter_effects`, and `psd_patterns`, with shared descriptor and big-endian primitives in `psd_descriptor` and `psd_binary`. `psd_layer_styles` owns the `psd_layer_effects.hpp` exports used by ASL I/O.

Shared internal constants, record types, and declarations live in `psd_io_internal.hpp`; never include it outside `src/psd`. Shared plumbing definitions live in `psd_io_common.cpp`. `psd_document_io.cpp` keeps the read drivers and public `DocumentIo` API. The writer is byte-pinned, so any body change must satisfy the serialization canaries.

## Other deliberate splits

- `ui/preset_tree_widget.{hpp,cpp}` is the generalized folder-grouped preset tree (reload preserving selection/collapse, folder expansion, click dispatch); `ui/style_browser.{hpp,cpp}` keeps `StyleBrowserWidget` as a thin adapter over it whose public API, signals, and objectNames are load-bearing for `layer_style_dialog.cpp` and UI tests. `ui/preset_manager_scaffold.{hpp,cpp}` owns the shared manager-dialog shell (layout, action rows, delete plumbing, use_selected); each `*_manager_dialog.cpp` keeps its previews, persistence, import/export, extra buttons, and strings local so translation contexts and per-dialog behavior deltas stay put. The gradient manager deliberately shares only the button row: its tree is structurally different (non-modal, nested slash-path folders, expanded-set semantics).
- `render/layer_style_mask_ops.{hpp,cpp}` owns the non-template layer-style mask machinery (max-filter/dilate, the exact EDT, stroke distance fields, blur/expand/supersample mask preparation, chamfer falloff, bevel height mask, and Satin mask preparation including `PreparedSatin`). `layer_compositor.hpp` includes the header, so consumers are unchanged; the per-pixel `composite_*`/`render_*` templates, `StyleMaskProvider`, and `style_mask_for_render` stay in `layer_compositor.hpp` because type-erasing the render target would put a virtual call in the reference compositor's per-pixel path. Mask math and iteration order are byte-pinned by the compositor canaries; keep bodies verbatim when reorganizing.
- `ui/adjustment_dialogs.cpp` owns the per-adjustment dialog half of `filter_workflows.cpp`: Levels widgets, adjustment requests, and Hue/Saturation converters. `filter_workflows.cpp` keeps catalog helpers, generic filter settings, Smart Filter blending, and pixel application. Their shared private helpers live in `ui/filter_workflows_internal.hpp`, which no other TU may include.
- `core/document_geometry.cpp` owns crop, rotate, flip, image/canvas resize, and `DocumentChannel` geometry from `pixel_tools.cpp`. Painting stays in `pixel_tools.cpp` and is byte-pinned by `tool_write_paths_digest_baseline`. `core/pixel_tools.hpp` remains the umbrella header; cross-half private helpers are declared in `core/pixel_tools_internal.hpp`, which no other directory may include. Geometry uses public `core/blend_math.hpp` for `clamp_byte`, and callers outside `pixel_tools.cpp` pass `extension_color` explicitly.
- `ui/gradient_preset_popup.{hpp,cpp}` owns the anchored gradient quick-picker popup shared by the layer-style Preset buttons, the gradient toolbar Presets button, and the Edit Gradient Stops dialog. Its child objectNames are derived from the anchor button's objectName and are load-bearing for `layer_style_dialog.cpp` and UI tests.
- The core test suite uses thematic TUs under `tests/core`; the UI suite uses thematic TUs under `tests/ui`. Their registration and helper rules live in [testing.md](testing.md).

## Build-system ownership

`patchy-mcp` is a native console target sharing `src/app/main.cpp` initialization
and `patchy_ui` with the application. `app/mcp_server.cpp` owns startup/proxying,
`app/mcp_stdio.cpp` owns binary stdio, `ui/mcp_session.cpp` owns shared request
lifetime, `ui/mcp_attachment.cpp` owns the interactive app's local socket, and
`ui/mcp_activity.cpp` owns the status-bar indicator and request input guard.
`ui/script_automation.cpp` owns state/preview/history and validates
strokes; `ui/canvas_widget_script_stroke.cpp` calls the existing native stroke
helpers. The shared `patchy_agent_kit` target assembles the installable skill and
copies authoritative API references once. See [ai-control.md](ai-control.md).

CMake runtime assets use shared copy-once targets: `patchy_bundled_fonts`, `patchy_qt_runtime`, and `patchy_qt_base_translations` (one `qtbase_<code>.qm` per language in `PATCHY_TRANSLATED_LANGUAGES`). Never attach per-target POST_BUILD copies into the shared output directory because parallel Ninja builds can race. New executables call the existing `patchy_copy_*` helpers.

Strict warnings belong to Patchy targets. Do not weaken a target's warning level to
accommodate bundled miniz, stb, zstd, or another third-party translation unit. If a
vendored source emits an unavoidable diagnostic, attach the smallest toolchain-specific
exclusion to that source file and warning number. Do not edit vendored code for warning
style. Wholly vendored library targets keep any upstream warning policy isolated on
that target.

On Apple platforms, guarded `CMP0156` and `CMP0179` use the modern linker's static
library rescan and first-occurrence behavior. This removes duplicate-library linker
diagnostics without flattening or reordering Patchy's target dependency graph. Keep the
policies Apple-only and retain the existing `target_link_libraries` ownership.
