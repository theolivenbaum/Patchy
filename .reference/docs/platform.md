# Platform notes (macOS/Linux ports)

Deep reference for cross-platform work. Read this before hunting a platform-specific regression, adding a platform-guarded site, or changing packaging/build configuration.

## Cross-platform implementation rules

Linux offscreen app and MCP startup disables the process's desktop D-Bus session
before constructing QApplication. Qt loads the Flatpak portal theme even for
offscreen and synchronously queries appearance; a missing portal otherwise delays
startup and client EOF. Interactive desktop runs retain the normal bus and portals.

Windows is the lead platform and must not regress. Every code change still completes the Windows release handoff in `AGENTS.md`. Changes to platform guards, CMake files/presets, or packaging additionally run the affected macOS and/or Linux remote build best-effort and report its result.

- Prefer a small local `#ifdef Q_OS_WIN`, `Q_OS_MACOS`, or `Q_OS_LINUX` (`_WIN32` in Qt-free code) with a portable fallback. Split into `foo_win.cpp`, `foo_mac.mm`, and `foo_linux.cpp` behind `WIN32`, `APPLE`, and `UNIX AND NOT APPLE` only when the site needs Objective-C++/system frameworks or outgrows about one screenful. Per-OS files live beside their feature, not in a platform directory.
- Window-frame code stays in `main_window_chrome.cpp`. `MainWindow::use_custom_window_chrome()` is the only gate: true on Windows for the frameless window, custom title-bar controls, and Qt edge resizing; false on macOS/Linux for native frames. macOS uses the native global menu bar, so never call `setNativeMenuBar(false)` outside gated `configure_window_chrome()` code.
- Tests obtain fonts through `tests/test_fonts.hpp`. Its Windows candidates preserve historical baselines. Triage a macOS/Linux failure by fixing a real bug first, then a platform-specific skip with a reason, then a platform-specific baseline. Never loosen a tolerance globally to make one platform pass.
- File formats remain byte-identical across operating systems. Use explicit endian and fixed-width primitives; never serialize `size_t`, `long`, `wchar_t`, or raw structs.
- Read environment variables through `core/environment.hpp`. The helper returns an owned string so callers never retain process-environment storage, and its Windows implementation avoids the deprecated `getenv` diagnostic.
- Never derive a font size by arithmetic on `pointSizeF()`. A QFont carries its size in either points or pixels and the unused accessor returns -1; macOS resolves inherited widget fonts by pixel size, so `f.setPointSizeF(f.pointSizeF() * 0.85)` asks for -0.85 there. Qt refuses it with `QFont::setPointSizeF: Point size <= 0` and leaves the font unchanged, so text meant to be smaller silently renders at full size on macOS only, and the offscreen suite emits the warning thousands of times. Clamping with `std::max(7.0, ...)` hides the warning and pins the size to the floor, which is the same bug without the diagnostic. Use `scale_font_size` / `scaled_font` / `offset_font` from `dialog_utils.hpp`; they branch on the unit the font actually carries.

## Warning verification

Patchy keeps warnings non-fatal, but supported clean builds must produce no compiler,
linker, or `lrelease` warnings. Build the default target so the application and every
test binary compile.

| Platform | Debug preset | Release preset |
|---|---|---|
| Windows MSVC | `debug` | `release` |
| macOS Clang arm64 | `mac-dev` | `mac-release` |
| Linux GCC x64 | `linux-dev` | `linux-release` |

For warning verification, clean each build directory, configure the preset, build it,
and search the complete combined stdout/stderr log for `warning` and `error`. A clean
Release build on each platform also runs the full core and offscreen UI suites.
Run `patchy_curves_clipping_preview_tests` and `patchy_perf_tests` when validating a
cross-platform cleanup or changing their dependencies.

The remote helper exercises the Release preset:

```powershell
scripts\remote\remote-build.ps1 -Target mac
scripts\remote\remote-build.ps1 -Target linux
```

After it snapshots the tree, use the corresponding remote checkout for clean
`mac-dev` or `linux-dev` verification. The snapshot push lives in
`scripts\remote\remote-snapshot.ps1`, shared with `build-wasm-st-remote.ps1` (the
wasm section of [release-process.md](release-process.md)). Do not add `-Werror` or `/WX`; a new warning is
fixed in source or isolated at the exact vendored source and diagnostic.

GCC-only diagnostics MSVC never reports (September 2026): `-Wmissing-field-initializers`
fires when a positional aggregate initializer stops before a member that has no default
member initializer (a new trailing member breaks every older `T{a, b, c}` site), and
`-Wunused-function` fires for a dead helper in an
anonymous namespace. Name the members with designated initializers, and delete dead helpers.

### The flatpak build is a second Linux compiler

A warning reported by the flatpak release build usually cannot be reproduced or
verified by `remote-build.ps1 -Target linux`. The two use different compilers and
different flags: `linux-release` on the linux build host is the system `/usr/bin/c++` (GCC 13.3.0 on
Ubuntu 24.04) with only `-O3 -DNDEBUG -std=c++20 -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic`, while
`packaging/linux/make-flatpak.sh` builds inside `org.kde.Sdk//6.11` with GCC 15.2.0 and
flatpak-builder's hardening flags (`-Wp,-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=3 -Wp,-D_GLIBCXX_ASSERTIONS
-fstack-protector-strong -fstack-clash-protection -fcf-protection -fno-omit-frame-pointer`,
then `-O3 -DNDEBUG` on top). Both the newer libstdc++ headers and `_GLIBCXX_ASSERTIONS`
change inlining enough to produce optimizer diagnostics the plain preset never emits.
The August 2026 `-Wfree-nonheap-object` and `-Warray-bounds=` false positives in
`psd_filter_effects.cpp` and `af_document_io.cpp` were both invisible to the preset
build and both reproduced under these flags.

Checking a single translation unit is far cheaper than a full flatpak run. Take the
object's `FLAGS` and `INCLUDES` from a previous flatpak build tree
(`packaging/linux/.flatpak-builder/build/patchy-*/build.ninja`, which survives
`--force-clean`) and compile it with the SDK compiler:

    flatpak run --filesystem=home --command=g++ org.kde.Sdk//6.11 <INCLUDES> <FLAGS> \
      -c ~/patchy/src/src/formats/af_document_io.cpp -o /dev/null

Compiling a copy of the pre-fix file the same way confirms a fix actually removed the
warning instead of merely being compiled by something that never reported it.

## Remote build machinery

The machines this checkout can reach are developer-specific and never named in the repository. Their ssh targets live in `scripts/remote/hosts.local.json` (gitignored; copy `scripts/remote/hosts.example.json`), which every remote script reads through `scripts/remote/remote-hosts.ps1`. Hardware notes and per-machine quirks go in `agents_local.md` (see AGENTS.md). Both files live in the main checkout; worktree runs fall back to the main checkout's copy. Below, `<mac-build-host>`, `<linux-build-host>`, and `<windows-build-host>` stand for those ssh targets.

macOS (arm64, preset `mac-release`, Qt at `.deps/Qt/6.8.3/macos`) and Linux (preset `linux-release`, Qt at `.deps/Qt/6.8.3/gcc_64`) build remotely via `scripts\remote\remote-build.ps1 -Target mac|linux`, which snapshots the working tree (uncommitted changes included; it creates no commits or branches and does not touch the real index) to a bare repo (`~/patchy.git`) on the build host, builds there, and runs both suites (core + offscreen UI) with output streamed back. One-time machine provisioning is `scripts/remote/setup-mac.sh` / `setup-linux.sh` (idempotent: venv tools + Qt via aqtinstall + apt deps).

`remote-build.ps1` checks out over the one shared `~/patchy/src`, so first make sure no other session is using the box: `ssh <linux-build-host> "pgrep -af 'patchy_|ninja|cc1plus'"`. When it is busy, do not wait on or kill the other run: push the snapshot to a private ref (`refs/snapshots/<topic>`), clone `~/patchy.git` into `~/patchy-<topic>/src`, symlink `.deps` to `~/patchy/src/.deps`, configure and build the preset there with the environment lines from `build-and-test.sh`, and delete the clone and the ref afterwards.

### Windows offload build (on request only)

`remote-build.ps1 -Target windows` builds the real MSVC `release` preset on a second Windows machine. Use it only when Seth explicitly asks to offload a Windows build. The local `build\release` stays the release gate and the only packaging source.

- **Layout.** The bare repo is `~\patchy.git` (same push URL shape as mac/linux) and the work tree is the host config's `workTree`. Qt is the dev box's `.deps\Qt\6.8.3\msvc2022_64`, copied to the same relative path, so the unmodified `release` preset resolves it.
- **Toolchain.** VS 2026 Build Tools (MSVC x64, Windows SDK 10.0.26100, VS-bundled CMake and Ninja), Git for Windows, and Python 3.13 (the release configure requires a Python 3.8+ interpreter; the WindowsApps `python.exe` is only a Store alias). `scripts\vs-env.bat` finds Build Tools through vswhere when the dev box's Community path is absent. The bootstrapper is `https://aka.ms/vs/18/stable/vs_buildtools.exe`; `aka.ms/vs/18/release/...` redirects to Bing.
- **Provisioning.** `scripts/remote/setup-windows.ps1 -Root <dir>` is idempotent and prints the one-time Qt copy command when Qt is missing. Its header has the scp and ssh lines. The ssh account must be an administrator.
- **Remote half.** `scripts/remote/build-and-test.ps1` configures, builds with `-j 8` through `run-throttled.bat` (below-normal priority, so the machine stays usable), prints whether `patchy.exe` exists, and runs both suites. `-TestFilter` filters the UI suite as on mac/linux; `-CoreTestFilter` (windows only) filters the core suite. Per-change runs follow the same scoped-filter rule as the dev box.
- **Shell quirks.** A Windows OpenSSH server's default shell is Windows PowerShell 5.1: no `&&`, and ad-hoc remote scripts are best sent as a file because local PowerShell expands `$_` and mangles embedded double quotes. `Get-Process a,b` exits 1 when any name is absent, so do not chain it with `&&`.
- **Smart App Control must be off.** The build itself runs fresh unsigned executables (`patchy_check_translation_runtime` runs `patchy_translation_checks.exe`, and the suites follow). With Smart App Control on, Code Integrity blocks them at random ("blocked by your organization's Device Guard policy", CodeIntegrity events 3033/3077), so the build fails at that step. It has no per-folder exclusions, and turning it off cannot be undone without reinstalling Windows, so it is the machine owner's decision. Check with `(Get-MpComputerStatus).SmartAppControlState`.
- **Busy check.** One shared work tree, like the linux host: first run `ssh <windows-build-host> "Get-Process cl,link,ninja,cmake,patchy_core_tests,patchy_ui_visual_tests -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue"`, and never kill another session's build there.

## AddressSanitizer runs (order-dependent heap bugs)

The `linux-asan` preset (RelWithDebInfo + `-fsanitize=address`, own `build/linux-asan` dir) is the tool for crashes that only reproduce in the full ordered suite (teardown and store use-after-frees). Sync the tree with `remote-build.ps1 -Target linux -SkipTests`, then build and run the instrumented suites on the box:

    ssh <linux-build-host> "ASAN_OPTIONS='quarantine_size_mb=8192:malloc_context_size=25:detect_leaks=0' \
      bash ~/patchy/src/scripts/remote/build-and-test.sh linux-asan"

The large quarantine keeps long-ago frees poisoned for the whole run, so the host needs plenty of RAM; `detect_leaks=0` keeps exits quiet. The UI suite's POSIX SIGSEGV/SIGBUS reporter steps aside under ASAN (`tests/ui/main.cpp`) so sanitizer reports are not preempted. A fresh build dir also surfaces stale `test-artifacts` expectations that long-lived dirs hide; see [testing.md](testing.md).

## Platform-specific site inventory (keep current)

- `main_window_chrome.cpp` + the `use_custom_window_chrome()` call sites in `main_window.cpp` (frameless flag, chrome controls).
- `psd_document_io.cpp` DirectWrite font resolution + wide-string helpers (portable heuristic fallback).
- `layer_list_widget.cpp` drag-wheel low-level mouse hook (degrades gracefully).
- `dialog_utils.cpp` `use_qt_file_dialog_controls` (Qt dialog widgets only under offscreen; native/portal dialogs otherwise, on every OS).
- The Print dialog's "Print Using System Dialog..." is always `QPrintDialog`, with no offscreen switch, so the UI test checks the button and never clicks it. On Windows 11 22H2+ that is the "unified" `PrintDlgEx` dialog, which shows "This app doesn't support print preview" to every Win32 caller (only WinRT `PrintManager` apps get a preview there). Do not switch it to the classic `PrintDlg` + `PD_ENABLEPRINTHOOK` dialog again: tried in August 2026 for a `0x80070002` error that was a broken Microsoft Print to PDF install, and the classic dialog only hides the driver's options behind Properties....
- `print_dialog.cpp` `ensure_printer_driver_usable` / `windows_printer_device_is_usable` (Windows only): when `CreateDC` fails (a Microsoft Print to PDF with a broken port registration, `ERROR_PATH_NOT_FOUND`), `QWin32PrintEnginePrivate::initialize` nulls the DEVMODE and `QPageSetupDialog::exec` crashes on it, while the spooler still hands out a DEVMODE. The guard therefore tests the device context, not the DEVMODE, and Print, Page Setup, and the system dialog report "Printer unavailable" instead.
- Windows print-color complaints (right on screen, shifted on paper) are not Patchy's: the spooled PCL XL stream is byte-exact (verified August 2026, Brother HL-L3230CDW, by giving a `NativeFormat` `QPrinter` a non-`.pdf` output name, which `StartDoc` writes to as `DOCINFO.lpszOutput`), and its PJL header shows RGB-to-CMYK happens in printer firmware. Converting the composite before `drawImage` changes nothing (`QWin32PrintEngine` re-tiles to opaque RGB32 itself); fix it on the printer.
- `dialog_utils_mac.mm` `keep_dialog_above_parent_window` (macOS child-window anchor for non-modal dialogs - see [ui-conventions.md](ui-conventions.md); no-op elsewhere; first Objective-C++ TU, `enable_language(OBJCXX)` is APPLE-gated in CMakeLists).
- `dialog_utils_mac.mm` `move_pointer_to_global_position` (October 2026): Qt's cocoa `QCursor::setPos` posts a synthetic CGEvent, so macOS asks the user to let Patchy control the computer (Accessibility). The macOS half calls `CGWarpMouseCursorPosition` instead, which needs no permission. Never call `QCursor::setPos` directly in `src/ui`; the one caller is the Alt+Right-drag brush adjust snapping the pointer back to its anchor.
- `dialog_utils.cpp` `screen_color_at_global_position` (the canvas eyedropper outside the document and the color picker's screen eyedropper): `QScreen::grabWindow` raises the macOS Screen Recording permission prompt, so on macOS it first renders the Patchy window under the point (`own_window_color_at_global_position`, a `QWidget::grab`, no permission). Only a pick outside Patchy's windows, or on a native title bar, reads the screen there. Other platforms keep the plain screen read. `ui_own_window_color_sample_reads_widget_without_screen_grab` pins the helper.
- Scanner import uses Windows WIA in `scanner_import_win.cpp` and macOS ImageKit/ImageCaptureCore in `scanner_import_mac.mm`; the macOS browser exposes local and network scanners but not cameras, and acquisition remains single-image on both platforms. The AppKit sheet is callback-based so the File menu action returns to the native run loop; never wait for it with a nested `QEventLoop`, which leaves its controls visible but unable to receive mouse input.
- The app stylesheet's `QCheckBox { border: none }` (macOS Aqua layout-item margin suppression - see [ui-conventions.md](ui-conventions.md)) and its APPLE-gated `QGroupBox` block + `brush_dynamics_popup.cpp` `compact_group_grid` (QMacStyle's Aqua group-box chrome and layout spacings blow dense panels past the screen; Windows keeps native metrics).
- `dialog_utils.cpp` `suppress_native_tab_bar_base` (macOS document-mode tab bars paint a light native base across their width even though the `::tab` rules still apply, so the document tabs and Preferences tabs drop the base; no-op elsewhere).
- `main.cpp` `InteractionHintsStyle::styleHint` macOS block (pins SH_FormLayoutFieldGrowthPolicy / LabelAlignment to the Windows behavior because QMacStyle otherwise keeps form fields at size-hint and right-aligns labels, shrinking Name/Folder-style edits to slivers) and the APPLE-gated QScrollBar block in `photoshop_style()` (Windows-classic dithered track via scroll-dither.svg, flat bordered handle, deliberately NO arrow buttons because fixed-size QSS line buttons make the groove degenerate on short scrollbars in collapsed docks; QMacStyle's flat overlay bars hide the handle on the dark theme).
- `main_window_files.cpp` `reveal_path_in_file_explorer`: the Windows branch must pass `/select,` and the file path as SEPARATE QProcess arguments. QProcess quotes any space-containing argument whole, and Explorer reads a quoted `"/select,path"` blob as unparseable, silently opening the default folder.
- `network_mounts.cpp` `read_system_mounts` (macOS `getmntinfo(MNT_NOWAIT)`, Linux `/proc/self/mounts`, empty on Windows where `GetDriveTypeW` answers): the recent-history existence check skips paths on non-local mounts and `autofs` triggers, because a stat on a stale share blocks for the whole network timeout and `main()` waits for that worker at quit. Reads cached kernel data only; never replace it with `statfs` on the path, which contacts the server. `ui_network_mount_classification_uses_deepest_mount_point` pins the matcher on a synthetic table.
- `main_window_files.cpp` `rebuild_recent_files_menu`: the recent-files filter row (a QWidgetAction-hosted line edit) is skipped when `menuBar()->isNativeMenuBar()` is true, because native menu bars (the macOS global bar, Linux appmenu desktops) cannot host widget actions; those platforms keep the plain paged menu. The check is false under `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen`, so the UI tests exercise the filter row on every platform.
- Optional Qt add-ons get their OWN `find_package(Qt6 QUIET COMPONENTS <X>)` and a `if(TARGET Qt6::X)` source swap, never a slot in `PATCHY_QT_COMPONENTS`: that lookup is QUIET, so one missing component silently skips the entire app target. Qt PDF is the current example (`pdf_import.cpp` vs `pdf_import_stub.cpp`, `PATCHY_HAVE_QT_PDF`); QtPrintSupport uses the same swap shape but keyed on EMSCRIPTEN because Qt simply publishes no wasm build of it. Both stubs must keep every entry point real enough to report the feature as unavailable.
- `update_checker.cpp` platform id (windows/macos/linux manifest keys).
- `single_instance.cpp` (Windows only): a relaunch grants `AllowSetForegroundWindow` to the pipe's server process (`GetNamedPipeServerProcessId`) before forwarding; the foreground lock otherwise refuses the running instance's activation and its window only flashes on the taskbar. The receiver comes forward on arrival (`bring_to_front_for_second_instance`, modal dialog first): the grant expires before a deferred file open runs.
- `main.cpp` Windows app-font candidates + macOS `Contents/Resources` probes (with `localization.cpp`'s translations probe).
- File paths: every `QString` -> `std::filesystem::path` conversion goes through `to_filesystem_path` (and the reverse through `to_qstring`) in `ui/qt_paths.hpp`, which uses `toStdU16String()` (UTF-16 -> native on every platform; `toStdString()` is UTF-8 and MSVC decodes a narrow `std::string` with the ANSI code page, which mangled a Save As "せす.psd"; `toStdWString` is UTF-32 on POSIX). Path pieces become UTF-8 text through `path_to_utf8` in `support/path_utils.hpp`, never `path::string()` (ANSI on MSVC, `?` for every unrepresentable character). Patchy deliberately ships no UTF-8 `activeCodePage` manifest: it would cover only `patchy.exe`, flip every ANSI API process-wide, and hide the wrong idiom instead of removing it. Pinned by the `unicode_path_*` core group and the `ui_unicode_*` UI group (names in `tests/unicode_path_names.hpp`); the UI tests compare names NFC-normalized because macOS stores NFD, the core tests use `std::filesystem::equivalent`.
- Tests: `test_harness.hpp`, the paired crash reporters in `tests/ui/main.cpp`, `test_fonts.hpp`.

## Color scheme and native chrome

`ThemeManager` mirrors the resolved scheme onto Qt with `QStyleHints::setColorScheme` (`unsetColorScheme` for "follow system"). On Windows that is what re-tints the chrome Patchy does not style: native dialog title bars, dock and list scroll bars, tooltips, `QMessageBox`, and the color picker all follow the app's choice, so there is no `DWMWA_USE_IMMERSIVE_DARK_MODE` call and no registry read. Under `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen` the call is a no-op and `colorScheme()` reports `Unknown`, which is what keeps the whole UI suite deterministic regardless of the host's Windows setting.

The frameless main window has no native title bar to tint; it draws its own 1px edge from the `window_border` role, which the Light palette overrides explicitly so the window keeps a silhouette against a light desktop. `DWMWA_BORDER_COLOR` in `main_window_chrome.cpp` stays unconditionally `COLOR_NONE`.

## Styled QCheckBox and QMacStyle margins

A stylesheet-styled QCheckBox needs a NON-native border in some matching rule. The app stylesheet's global `QCheckBox { border: none; }` covers this; do not remove it. Qt only suppresses QMacStyle's Aqua layout-item margins (checkboxes: +2,+3,-9,-4) for styled widgets whose rule has a non-native border (qstylesheetstyle.cpp, SE_*LayoutItem). With the margins active, box layouts deliberately overlap the neighboring label ~9px into the checkbox. That is right for the inset native glyph, but on the flat 12px stylesheet indicator the label lands ON the box (the 0.13-mac "text jammed into the checkbox" Layer Style bug). This is only reproducible in the real app: the test harness never loads the QMacStyle plugin, so offscreen/test runs cannot catch a regression here.

## Per-platform test skips (keep this list current)

On macOS/Linux: `ui_bundled_legacy_plugin_action_applies_filter`, `ui_transparency_checkerboard_and_copy_paste_preserve_alpha`, `ui_legacy_plugin_run_respects_selection_and_undoes`, `ui_legacy_plugin_mehdi_filters_run_if_available`, `ui_legacy_plugin_mehdi_dialog_capture_if_available`, `ui_legacy_plugin_menu_opens_folder_and_rescans` and `ui_about_dialog_has_plugins_folder_row` (the legacy 8BF host and its folder UI are Windows-only, see docs/plugins.md; `ui_legacy_plugin_ui_absent_off_windows` runs instead; the contact sheet drops the shim artifacts) plus the core `legacy_host_self_test_filters_fixtures_in_both_bitnesses` (not registered off Windows), `ui_frameless_window_edges_resize` (native frame owns resize borders; gated on `use_custom_window_chrome()`), and the two `ui_imported_psd_box_text_line_clip_*` tests (they pin Windows Arial line metrics; CoreText/fontconfig lay lines out a few px differently). `ui_main_window_renders_color_controls` asserts frameless/badge/window-buttons **presence on Windows and absence elsewhere**. Local-fixture (`local-test-fixtures/`) tests `[SKIP]` on the remotes until the corpus is copied there (sync recipe in [testing.md](testing.md)).

Text tests additionally gate on the fixture's own face. All three guards live in `tests/ui/ui_test_support.cpp`, and all three exist for the same two reasons: a substituted face turns a pinned geometry tolerance into a measurement of the substitute, and entering a text session without the face raises the Missing Font prompt, which nothing can answer under offscreen (the suite HANGS in the nested dialog loop instead of failing).

- `skip_without_arial_for_psd_text_preview()` gates seven imported-PSD raster-preview text tests, the three `ui_af_*` text tests, and `ui_warp_text_render_matches_photoshop_if_available`. macOS ships genuine Arial in `/System/Library/Fonts/Supplemental` and runs all eleven green; Linux ships Liberation, not Arial, and skips them.
- `skip_without_font_face(family, role)` gates on a face being reachable at all, matching MainWindow's family-or-`"family style"` split (Qt files Arial Black under family Arial, style Black). Candara (`restaurant-menu-inside.psd`) and Bookman Old Style (`dungeon-scroll-game-screen.psd`) are Windows-only; Georgia is Windows and macOS.
- `skip_without_psd_text_face(layer, family)` adds the second way a machine lands off the Windows baseline: the family the imported layer actually resolved to. PSD PostScript names go through DirectWrite on Windows and the Qt font database elsewhere (`install_font_database_psd_font_resolver` in `src/ui/psd_font_resolver.hpp`, installed by the app and the UI test main; the suffix-stripping heuristic in `psd_text_read.cpp` is the last resort, and wasm stays heuristic-only so bundled alias families are never baked into imported metadata). The database resolver handles both shapes a face can take off Windows, whole family ("Arial Black") and family "Arial" + style "Black", mirroring the DirectWrite output rules (flag-expressible faces stay family + flags, mid weights keep the real face without the bold flag, Black/Heavy keeps the full name plus bold). The guard therefore fires only when the face was absent from the database at read time: the `snes-box-a3.psd` probes run on Windows and macOS and skip on Linux, which has no Arial Black. Tests must register a fixture's face BEFORE reading the PSD.

## Remote suites with the fixture corpus present

`local-test-fixtures/` is copied to the mac and linux build hosts, so both remotes run the fixture-gated text tests and every suite is expected to pass there; a `[SKIP]` line reports each thing a machine cannot cover, including one line per `local-test-fixtures` PSD a test names that is not present. The core result includes `composite_corpus_flatten_digests_are_stable` against the tracked baselines in `test-fixtures/psd`: the CPU compositor is byte-identical across Windows, macOS arm64/clang, Linux x86-64/GCC, and wasm. Do not re-pin those baselines per machine.

Most corpus differences are the face gates listed above; three tests needed something else:

- `ui_warp_text_render_matches_photoshop_if_available` (macOS only - Linux has no Arial) compares Patchy's warp against Photoshop PNGs of Windows Arial. CoreText costs ~0.06 of IoU and ~2px of ink extent on the point-text cases without moving the warp geometry, so off Windows the IoU floors scale by 0.90 and the bounds tolerance gains 2px. Every case reports its numbers before the test fails, so one run shows the whole picture.
- `ui_duke_psd_text_runs_survive_reedit` reflows `Duke nukem mobile.psd`'s body between the first and second apply. Its face (FuturaLT-ExtraBold) is installed nowhere, so what reflows is each platform's substitute: 30px on Windows, 102 on macOS, 127 on Linux. Windows keeps the measured 64/32px bound; elsewhere it is a tenth of the block. The fixed point that follows (identical metadata, byte-identical third apply) is platform-independent and unchanged.
- `ui_font_picker_applies_a_pick_the_control_already_shows` sets the picker to a family the database lacks. Doing that makes CoreText (and fontconfig on its first miss) fill in font-family aliases lazily, and that repopulation re-emits the combo's current row, whose handler writes the displayed family back over the missing one - so the control never held the state under test. Aliases fill in once, so the test sets it a second time. `ui_text_font_picker_preview_shows_supported_scripts` has the same shape of fix: it takes the first Japanese family the PICKER lists rather than the font database's first, because `QFontComboBox`'s model drops families the database still reports.

## macOS menubar submenus and Qt's menu-role heuristic

Qt's Cocoa plugin merges an item directly under a top-level menu into the app menu when its title starts with the translated "About", "Config", "Preference", "Options", "Setting", "Setup", "Quit" or "Exit", re-checking on every sync, so a runtime language switch flips items ("Ajustes", "Réglages"). A merged SUBMENU crashes Qt 6.8.3 on the next window activation (`setSubmenu:` on its freed old `NSMenuItem`; GitHub issue 29). Every menubar submenu action gets `QAction::NoRole` (`exclude_submenus_from_native_menu_roles` and the dynamic submenu builders; `ui_menubar_submenus_have_no_native_menu_role` guards it, `ui_language_switch_survives_window_reactivation` under `PATCHY_UI_TEST_PLATFORM=cocoa NSZombieEnabled=YES` reproduces the crash). New dynamic submenus need it too.

## macOS synthesized font stretch (Photoshop HorizontalScale)

Qt 6.8's CoreText engine applies `QFont::setStretch` to advances TWICE: the stretch is baked into the CTFont matrix and `loadAdvancesForGlyphs` multiplies the already-scaled advances by it again (qfontengine_coretext.mm), so stretch 90 rendered at 81% and the SNES box blurb lost 10% of its line length against Photoshop's raster on macOS. DirectWrite/GDI scale advances once; FreeType derives the face's x char-size from the stretch, also once. `set_stretch_for_advance_ratio` (main_window.cpp) therefore decides between the historical `round(ratio x 100)` encoding and the sqrt-compensated one by MEASURING the font at hand (which candidate's 'H' advance lands the requested ratio). Per font, not per platform or per process: a font with a native width axis answers `setStretch` through real width matching (`.AppleSystemUIFont` measured x0.39 at stretch 50, neither linear nor squared, and a one-per-process probe cached off it and broke the suite's ordered runs), and a missing family's fallback engine ignores stretch entirely (both error measurements tie, keeping the historical value). On linear engines the naive candidate measures ~exact and always wins, so Windows/Linux pinned pixels stay bit for bit; a Qt release that fixes CoreText flips macOS back by itself, and the SNES box probes pin the rendered result. Accepted residue: glyph OUTLINES on macOS render sqrt(ratio) wide (the matrix half of the double application); advances, line breaks, and ink extents are what Photoshop parity needs.

## macOS non-modal dialog anchoring

On macOS, `run_non_modal_dialog` anchors the dialog as a native child window of its parent widget's window (`keep_dialog_above_parent_window`, dialog_utils_mac.mm): macOS has no Win32 owned-window z-order, so clicking the edit-locked main window buried the dialog behind it and the app looked frozen (0.13 mac bug). The anchor attaches on Show (deferred one event-loop turn) and MUST detach on Hide/Close because AppKit re-orders attached children with their parent even when hidden. Any new non-modal dialog path that bypasses `run_non_modal_dialog` needs the same call.
