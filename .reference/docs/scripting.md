# JavaScript scripting

Patchy embeds a JavaScript engine (Qt's QJSEngine, from the Qt6Qml module) with its own
document automation API, a Script Manager dialog (the `file.scripts.editor` command id
and `scriptEditor*` object names keep the old "Script Editor" spelling; persisted
identifiers are never renamed), bundled
example scripts, and a CLI entry point that lets external tools and AI agents drive a
running Patchy. This doc is the authoritative record of the design rules; the
user-facing docs are `scripts/bundled/scripting-guide.md` (the human-readable guide,
linked from the README and rendered in-app from Help > Scripting Guide) and
`scripts/bundled/patchy.d.ts` (TypeScript definitions). BOTH must track every API
change.

## Where things live

- `src/ui/script_engine.{hpp,cpp}`: `ScriptEngineHost`, the engine owner. Run lifecycle,
  bootstrap prelude (console/timers/include/the `patchy` namespace), watchdog, undo and
  refresh integration, and every MainWindow-facing service the wrappers call
  (including the interactive helpers: alert/prompt/pickers/`showDialog`/`runCommand`).
  `ScriptEngineHost` is a friend of MainWindow; the wrappers never touch MainWindow
  directly.
- `src/ui/script_api.{hpp,cpp}`: the QObject wrappers JS sees (`app`, documents, layers,
  selection, `patchy.io`, `patchy.ui`, `patchy.recovery`, `patchy.plugins`; the last one
  and `layer.applyPlugin` front the legacy 8BF host, see [plugins.md](plugins.md)).
- `src/ui/script_vector*.{hpp,cpp}`: native shapes, paints, paths, masks,
  organization, and selection bindings. See [vector-automation.md](vector-automation.md)
  for shared operations, validation, and refresh contracts.
- `ui/script_brush` and `ui/brush_automation`: brush bindings, resolution and
  presets; see [brush-automation.md](brush-automation.md).
- `src/ui/script_canvas_window.{hpp,cpp}`: interactive script windows (games/demos).
- `src/ui/script_editor_dialog.{hpp,cpp}` + `src/ui/js_syntax_highlighter.{hpp,cpp}`: the
  Script Manager UI (folder tree, shadow-override saves, context menu, and the run
  status area: spinner, "Running... 13s" readout and stop button during a run, "Ready"
  otherwise; the elapsed clock is dialog-local and restarts when run_state_changed
  reports a run became active). The C:\ toolbar button and the "Command Line
  Example..." context entry open the copyable-command dialog (below); Help opens the
  scripting guide. A single click or arrow-key step loads a tree script; with unsaved
  edits, selection changes never load or prompt, and switching goes through activation
  (double-click/Enter), which asks to discard. New (toolbar button, and New Script on
  every folder row's context menu) seeds a runnable starter template, left unmodified
  so an untouched template never guards or prompts.
- `src/ui/markdown_viewer_dialog.{hpp,cpp}`: the reusable read-only Markdown viewer
  (QTextBrowser via setSource; relative images resolve against the .md file, anchors
  are repainted in the accent blue because the importer's default is unreadable on
  dark). `MainWindow::open_scripting_guide()` (main_window_scripting.cpp) owns the
  single instance, shared by Help > Scripting Guide (`help.scripting_guide`) and the
  Script Manager's Help button. Help > Set up AI Control
  (`help.ai_setup`, `MainWindow::open_ai_setup_dialog()`) is the sibling entry for the
  MCP connector; see [ai-control.md](ai-control.md).
- `src/ui/script_folders.{hpp,cpp}`: the script browser model - recursive bundled/user
  folder scans and the shadow-override merge, shared by the File > Scripts menu and the
  editor tree.
- `src/ui/main_window_scripting.cpp`: the File > Scripts menu (subfolders become
  submenus), the editor entry, and the CLI flows (`run_script_command`, `run_cli_script`).
- `scripts/bundled/` (repo): bundled scripts + `patchy.d.ts` + `scripting-guide.md`,
  staged next to the binaries by the `patchy_bundled_scripts` copy-once target (macOS:
  `Contents/Resources/scripts`,
  Linux install: `share/patchy/scripts`). ONLY `scripts/bundled` ships - the rest of
  `scripts/` is dev tooling and must never be staged (the copy step cleans the staged
  folder first, so renames/removals propagate to existing build trees; the macOS bundle
  POST_BUILD does the same rm-rf-then-copy into Resources/fonts, /translations, and
  /scripts). Bundled scripts
  are organized into `Games/`, `Demos/`, `Effects/`, `Utilities/` (display names go
  through `script_folder_display_name` for localization). Bundled-script convention:
  only `Games/` scripts create their own document or window; every other bundled script
  works on the ACTIVE document and alerts "Open a document first." when none is open.
  One carve-out: a Utilities script may create a document when that document IS its
  stated output (`contact-sheet.js`). Every bundled script must
  also finish cleanly unattended under `--run-script` (cancelled pickers return "",
  showDialog answers its defaults). User scripts live
  in the per-user app-data folder under `scripts/` (`MainWindow::user_scripts_directory()`).
- Tests: `tests/ui/scripting_tests.cpp`.

## Script metadata and icons

Header directives live in the `//` comment block at the top of a script and are read by
`read_script_metadata` (script_folders.cpp; parsing stops at the first non-comment line,
30 lines max):

- `// @name Breakout` - display name shown in the Script Manager tree and the
  File > Scripts menu (falls back to the file base name). Files sort by display name.
- `// @description ...` - the hover-card blurb; repeated `@description` lines join with
  a space.
- `// @author ...` - the hover-card credit line.
- `// @window` - the script creates its own window or document. Rendered as a small
  window badge; scripts without it work on the active document. Set on the three Games
  plus contact-sheet.js.
- `// @cli ...` - the argument part of the script's command-line example: everything
  after `--run-script <script>`, verbatim (repeated lines join with a space, like
  `@description`). Consumed by `script_cli_example_command` (script_folders.cpp), which
  builds the copyable command: exe path + `--run-script` + quoted script path + the
  `@cli` tokens. Without `@cli` the fallback appends an ` example.png` positional
  placeholder for active-document scripts and nothing for `@window` scripts, so every
  script gets a working example. Utilities scripts that take `--script-arg` options
  carry `@cli` lines; simple active-document effects rely on the fallback.

A same-stem 128x128 PNG is the script icon, displayed at 32px in the tree and
96px in its hover card; missing icons use `script_generic_icon`. User PNGs override
bundled icons independently of script overrides. "Set Icon from Current Window"
uses `script_icon_write_target`/`write_script_icon` to center-crop and scale the
latest live script canvas, or the active document composite. The tree delegate in
script_editor_dialog.cpp paints name, filename, modified tag and window badge;
`item->text(0)` remains the display name. Its slot-driven `ScriptHoverCard`
Qt::ToolTip window shows icon, name, author, description and filename/badges after
about 350ms. Tree refresh clears hover state; rows have no plain tooltip.

Every bundled script carries `@name`/`@description`/`@author`, and every one has a
committed icon PNG, procedural artwork generated by `scripts/dev/make-script-icons.js`
(dev tooling, never staged) via `--run-script`. After adding a bundled script, add its
directives, extend the generator, and re-run it (its header comment shows the command).

## Script options (the OPTIONS block + showOptions pattern)

Every bundled script with tweakable behavior follows one shape, and new scripts should
too:

1. A clearly-marked `var OPTIONS = {...}` block at the top of the file holds the
   defaults with one comment per key.
2. The script calls `patchy.ui.showOptions({title, description, fields})` with the
   fields seeded from OPTIONS. `description` renders as wrapped instructions above the
   form, so scripts that need input explain what to pick.
3. showOptions implements "defaults unless overridden": matching `--script-arg
   key=value` tokens override the field defaults (coerced by field type; a bare token
   turns a checkbox on), unattended runs return the effective values WITHOUT a dialog,
   and GUI runs show the dialog seeded with them (null = cancelled, exit quietly).

"Unattended" is `ScriptEngineHost::unattended_run()`: app-wide CLI automation mode OR
the per-run `RunOptions.unattended` flag, which `run_script_command`/`run_cli_script`
set for every `--run-script` execution, INCLUDING requests forwarded to a running GUI
instance, so automation never blocks on a dialog. Every interactive helper honors it.

The form dialog (shared by showDialog/showOptions, `run_form_dialog` in
script_engine.cpp) also supports `folder` and `file` field types (path line edit +
Browse; values travel as "/" paths) and the `description` header. Games deliberately
show no dialog (OPTIONS block only - a game should just start); trim-to-content and
save-version stay instant too.

## Shadow overrides (saving over a bundled script)

Save on a bundled script never touches the shipped file (read-only installs; app updates
would clobber edits): the editor writes a user copy at the SAME relative path under the
user scripts folder (`Games/breakout.js` -> `<user scripts>/Games/breakout.js`). The scan
merge (`scan_scripts`) then shows that copy in place of the bundled entry - tagged
"(modified)" in the menu and tree - and it is what runs from the menu, the editor, and
`include()`. "My Scripts" lists only non-overriding user scripts. Revert to Bundled
(tree context menu) deletes the copy. Keep this override-by-relative-path rule intact
everywhere a bundled script is resolved.

## Engine rules (binding design decisions)

- **One run at a time, on the UI thread.** A run stays alive until the synchronous
  evaluation AND every timer and script canvas window are done. A fresh QJSEngine is
  created per run and destroyed at run end, so nothing leaks between runs and stored
  QJSValues die with their engine (canvas windows drop theirs in teardown first).
- **One undo entry per run and session by default.** The first mutation a run makes to a session
  pushes one "Script: name" snapshot (`prepare_mutation`); everything after rides it, so
  a 60fps animation undoes to its pre-script state in one step. Scripts can opt out for
  speed with `app.undoEnabled = false` (per-run state, resets to true each run): the
  snapshot is skipped and those edits cannot be undone, but sessions are still marked
  modified so closing protects the work. Connector sessions
  reject disabling history so failed edits remain recoverable. `patchy.ui.slowMode`
  instead separates native strokes and undoable edits; see [automation-feedback.md](automation-feedback.md).
- **Wrappers hold ids, never pointers.** Layer wrappers keep session id + LayerId and
  re-resolve on every access, throwing a JS error when the target is gone. The layers
  vector reallocates and sessions close; a stored `Layer*` is the historical
  use-after-free pattern. Reads resolve through const documents (mutable layer accessors
  bump revisions on access).
- **Refresh is coalesced.** Mutations mark per-session dirt; one deferred flush per
  event-loop turn repaints the canvas (region or full) and refreshes panels for the
  active session only. Structure changes (add/remove/reorder/rename) rebuild the layer
  panel; pixel-only changes refresh thumbnails.
  Visible MCP/CLI runs also present completed edits periodically. `patchy.ui.present`
  provides explicit frames and optional pacing. CLI runs have a status-bar Stop
  control despite being unattended. See [automation-feedback.md](automation-feedback.md).
  `patchy.ui.paused` parks visible automation after a native edit. Browsing stays
  available while working; paused manual edits split script Undo groups. See the
  API scope and resume safety rules in [automation-feedback.md](automation-feedback.md).
- **The watchdog measures INACTIVITY, never total runtime.** Legitimate scripts run for
  hours; a blanket runtime limit is wrong by design.
  A helper thread arms around every evaluate and callback, and every hot service call
  feeds it (a lock-free atomic in `pump_progress_indicator`); it calls
  `QJSEngine::setInterrupted` only when a script made NO API call - no pixel write,
  file operation, or console output - for the whole window (default 2 minutes;
  `PATCHY_SCRIPT_TIMEOUT_MS` overrides the window, which the tests use). That is the
  only possible defense against `while (true) {}`: a frozen UI thread cannot show any
  prompt. Pure-JS computation that goes silent longer than the window still dies -
  the documented convention is to log or write progress periodically (every heavy
  bundled script does; the same calls drive the busy overlay). Connector-owned
  runs instead use a throttled UI progress callback under the MCP input guard,
  allowing the status-bar Stop button without a modal panel. Never remove the
  arm/disarm pairing around a new entry point into script code; route new callback
  invocations through `call_script_callback`.
- **Reentrancy: never destroy the engine from inside script code.** Timer slots and
  window event filters run callbacks; a failing callback schedules a deferred finish
  (`schedule_completion_check` / the deferred `finish_run` path) instead of tearing down
  from inside itself. Stop during evaluation only interrupts; the evaluate caller
  finishes the run.
- **The automatic busy indicator pumps events mid-evaluation - keep the guards.**
  `pump_progress_indicator()` (called at the hot service entry points: prepare_mutation,
  note_*_changed, open/create/save/close session, apply_filter, add_text_layer,
  consoleEmit; it also feeds the watchdog, unconditionally) engages once the CURRENT
  synchronous burst (the main evaluate or one callback, timed by `burst_clock` and
  restarted per burst so a game of short frames never trips it) exceeds 500 ms
  (`PATCHY_SCRIPT_BUSY_DELAY_MS` overrides; skipped for unattended runs): the active
  canvas's processing overlay PLUS the application-modal `ScriptStopPanel` (script
  name, elapsed, last console line, refreshed per pump), then pumps
  `processEvents(AllEvents)`; modality leaves the panel's Stop button as the only
  reachable control while the script owns the UI thread.
  Stop opens a NON-BLOCKING confirm ("Stop 'name'?" with an "Undo the changes it made"
  checkbox, shown only when the run pushed undo snapshots); the job keeps working
  while the user decides (never exec a nested loop from the panel's handler: a
  timer-driven click could not be answered from its own nested loop). Cancel dismisses
  it; confirming interrupts the run and `finish_run` undoes the snapshot in every
  touched session. The confirm closes by itself when the run ends first.
  The invariants that make the pumping safe: the script timer slot defers when
  `sync_running || in_callback` (single-shots re-arm via `start(0)`) because QJSEngine
  is not reentrant; `end_progress_indicator()` closes overlay+panel when the burst,
  the session (close_session), or the run ends; and `ModalWatchdogPause` ends the
  indicator on entry (the panel must not fight the script's own dialogs) and restarts
  the burst clock on exit. `createCanvas` does the same through
  `dismiss_busy_indicator()`, and the panel is not raised at all while the run owns an
  open canvas window (`has_open_canvas_window`): a window created under an
  application-modal window is blocked by it and skipped by key delivery, permanently
  on wasm (docs/wasm.md).
  Side effect: the pump runs the coalesced refresh flush, so scripts that push pixels
  repeatedly paint progressively. A pure-JS loop with no API calls cannot pump, so heavy
  bundled scripts write their buffer to the layer a few times mid-computation
  (setPixels REPLACES the layer's pixels: re-send the whole buffer, never strips).
- **Palette mode**: `setPixels` and `fill` snap to the document palette like tools
  (`apply_palette_to_pixels`, dither None, the editing alpha threshold); `applyFilter`
  stays advisory, as interactive filters are. `doc.getPalette/setPalette/loadPalette/
  savePalette` expose palette metadata and file I/O; set/load validate before Undo, keep
  layer pixels, and default to enabled mode. The host assigns globally unique palette
  revisions, syncs indexed export metadata, and invalidates canvas and panel. Disabled
  mode keeps an attached table; getters read const and return copies. PNG save/export
  uses the indexed writer; previews stay truecolor. Optional parallel `names` arrays
  carry color labels through GPL, PSD and indexed PNG. See [palette-mode.md](palette-mode.md).
- **Text layers go through the real pipeline.** `addTextLayer` and the `text` setter
  drive actual inline-editor sessions (the `cli_append_text_to_text_layers` technique),
  so rasters render through the normal commit path. `addTextLayer` clears the active
  layer first so `add_text_at` cannot latch onto an existing text layer. Its `size` is
  the text height in DOCUMENT PIXELS: the inline editor's font lives in editor pixels
  (document px * canvas zoom), so the script path must set `setPixelSize(size * zoom)` -
  a point-sized font commits at a zoom-dependent size (pinned by
  `ui_script_text_size_is_zoom_independent`). Its `font` goes through
  `apply_text_family_to_editor` (the font picker's path): the commit reads the session
  family, not the char format (pinned by `ui_script_text_font_option_applies`). The `text` setter replaces the selection
  in one `insertText(text, format)` with the first character's format, never
  delete-then-insert: an emptied block's char format is the fallback font only, so the
  run would lose the exact size and glyph scales it renders from (pinned by
  `ui_la_methode_script_text_setter_matches_interactive_commit_if_available`).
  Rich runs (`addTextLayer([{text, font, size, bold, italic, color}, ...])`,
  `layer.setTextRuns`) type each run with its own `QTextCharFormat` on top of the base
  format through `apply_text_run_to_format` (`apply_text_family_to_format` for the family);
  a paragraph break serializes as its own run because Qt gives the block separator the
  preceding text's format. `box: {width, height}` passes the rect to `add_text_at`, which
  opens the session as paragraph text; `align` and `textAlign` go through
  `apply_text_alignment_to_editor` on the whole object. `textRuns`, `textBox` (null unless the
  flow metadata says box) and `textAlign` read the stored runs, box and paragraph-run
  metadata without a session. Scripted layers clear the options bar's recorded face
  (`kTextStyleNameFormatProperty`) and carry `kTextExactSizeFormatProperty`, so the
  requested face and size commit at every zoom (pinned by
  `ui_script_text_face_ignores_the_options_bar_style`,
  `ui_script_text_size_survives_low_zoom_reedit`, `ui_script_text_runs_create_and_read_back`,
  `ui_script_text_box_wraps_and_aligns`, `ui_script_set_text_runs_edits_existing_layer`).
- **A script move is a Move tool move.** `layer.moveTo` and the `x`/`y` setters shift
  the bounds, then call `translate_moved_layer_metadata` on the layer and every
  descendant: the linked mask, shape model, linked vector mask, smart-object quads and
  text transform (Photoshop's text anchor) travel with the pixels, and unlinked masks
  stay. Never shift a mask by hand beside that helper (it moves twice). A supported
  Smart Filter stack re-renders at the new place (`rerender_moved_smart_filters`); a
  failed render restores the document and throws. `alignLayers`/`distributeLayers`
  (`CanvasWidget::offset_layers`) and `duplicate(targetDocument)`
  (`offset_copied_layer_tree`) follow the same rule. A group has empty bounds: `x`/`y`
  read 0 and `moveTo` offsets its contents. Pinned by `ui_script_move_*`; Photoshop
  check: `scripts\dev\photoshop-text-move-check.ps1`.
- **Blend mode ids** (`script_blend_mode_id`) are a compatibility contract: scripts in
  the wild hard-code them. Append-only, aligned with the BlendMode enum, never rename.
- **`app.apiVersion` is 1.** Bump only for breaking changes. Record additions and
  behavioral changes in [scripting-api-changes.md](scripting-api-changes.md).
  The native MCP connector, stable-ID lookups, strokes, previews, history access,
  and structured script results are additive September 2026 APIs; see
  [ai-control.md](ai-control.md) for their contracts.
- **`include()` resolution order**: relative to the including script, then the user
  scripts root, then the bundled scripts root; a result inside the bundled folder maps
  through the shadow-override store. `patchy.isMainScript()` is false during an included
  file's top-level code (include-depth counter), so a script can be both a library and
  runnable (`Effects/fancy-background.js` is the model).
  include() preserves the including script's global `OPTIONS` binding across the nested
  evaluation (saved before, restored after): every bundled script carries a top-level
  OPTIONS block, and without this an include overwrote the includer's options with the
  library's.
- **Sound effects (`patchy.ui.playTone`/`playSound`)** play through
  `src/ui/sound_effects.{hpp,cpp}` + `sound_effects_mac.mm`: a deterministic 16-bit
  mono tone synth (volume baked into the amplitude) and per-OS fire-and-forget
  playback - winmm `PlaySound` (SND_MEMORY, static buffer keeps bytes alive, a new
  sound cancels the previous) on Windows, retained `NSSound`s on macOS, a detached
  `paplay`/`pw-play`/`aplay` process on Linux (none installed = silent no-op).
  Deliberately NOT Qt Multimedia: absent from the vendored Qt, and adding it would
  grow provisioning/packaging everywhere. `playSound` resolves relative paths the
  include() way, requires RIFF/WAVE, and throws for missing/invalid files.
  `PATCHY_NO_SOUND=1` validates but skips the OS call (how offscreen tests stay silent).
- **Modal helpers pause the watchdog.** Every interactive helper that blocks in a modal
  (alert, prompt, the pickers, `showDialog`, `runCommand`) wraps itself in
  `ModalWatchdogPause`, which disarms the watchdog and re-arms it with a FRESH timeout on
  exit - otherwise a user thinking at a dialog longer than the timeout gets the script
  interrupted the moment it resumes. New modal helpers must do the same.
- **`app.runCommand(id)`** triggers registered QActions by their stable HotkeyRegistry
  command id (the same ids the hotkey editor persists); returns false for unknown or
  disabled commands. It rides the same trust model as the rest of scripting.
- **`patchy.ui.zoom` / `patchy.ui.fitOnScreen()`** are the documented view controls
  (percent, active document). Connector sessions refuse `runCommand`; fitting settles
  posted layout first. Window captures wait for [Dynamic Vector Preview](vector-preview.md).
- The script canvas window deliberately bypasses `run_non_modal_dialog` (that helper
  parks the caller in a nested event loop until the dialog finishes, and the calling
  script must keep running). It applies `keep_dialog_above_parent_window` directly, which
  is the macOS-critical part of the rule. The editor dialog itself is opened through
  `run_non_modal_dialog` as usual.

## CLI and AI control

`patchy-mcp` provides a persistent workspace over local stdio MCP: offscreen by
default, a separate window with `--visible`, or the user's open workspace with
`--attach` (mutations then need an expected-state token). It shares application
startup and the scripting engine with `patchy`, isolates window preferences, shares
saved brushes and recent history, and ships the `patchy-control` skill. Setup,
lifecycle, indicators, protocol and packaging are in [ai-control.md](ai-control.md).

```
patchy [--headless] --run-script <file.js> [--script-output <out.txt>] [--script-arg key=value ...] [files...]
```

`--script-arg key=value` (repeatable) surfaces as `patchy.args.key` in the script (all
string values); the forwarded single-instance payload carries the raw tokens as extra
newline-separated fields after the output path, so keys and values must not contain
newlines. The bundled `Utilities/batch-export.js` is the reference consumer.

- With a running instance: file/script requests wait until any current script
  finishes before dispatch, including Finder opens. The request forwards over the single-instance socket (the
  `patchy-cmd:run-script` reserved entry, same scheme as `--screenshot`), the invoker
  exits immediately, and the running instance executes the script. Console output,
  errors, and a final `[done]` or `[failed]` line are written to the output file when the
  run fully completes; the caller polls for the file. Warnings are prefixed `[warn] `,
  errors `[error] `, plain log lines are unprefixed so scripts can emit clean data (JSON
  included). Forwarded runs are unattended (above).
- Without one: a new instance runs unattended (`cli_automation_mode_`: prompts are
  suppressed, `app.alert` logs, `app.prompt` returns its default), opens any positional
  files first, writes the output file, and exits 0 on success or 4 on script error
  (2 and 3 belong to `--export`). The exit goes through `exit_cli_application`
  (ui/cli_exit.hpp): on wasm that shuts the Emscripten runtime down so the page's
  qtloader receives the code via onExit; see docs/wasm.md.
- A script that keeps timers or windows alive writes its output when the last one ends,
  so automation scripts should not open windows.
- `--headless` (any CLI mode): `headless_flag_present` (`support/cli_flags.hpp`) scans
  raw argv before the QApplication exists and sets `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen` (the
  flag beats an ambient value), `PATCHY_HEADLESS=1` (lets the Windows registry font
  rescue run for a headless user; the offscreen suites never set it), and
  `PATCHY_NO_SOUND=1`. It forces single-instance off (never forwards, never listens),
  sets `cli_automation_mode_` in every mode, and exits 2 without a mode flag. Release
  packages ship the offscreen plugin and every packager smoke-tests it
  (docs/release-process.md).
- Successful unattended document opens and saves update recent files and their
  containing folders, including saved flat copies. Failed operations and preview
  captures do not add entries. `PATCHY_SETTINGS_DIR` isolates this history for tests.

An AI agent drives Patchy by writing a .js file, invoking `--run-script`, and polling the
output file.

The Script Manager's C:\ button shows that command for the selected script (tree
selection first, else the loaded file), built by `script_cli_example_command`. The
metadata is re-read from disk on every click (never cached), and the dialog is opened
with `open()` (window-modal, no nested event loop).
Shell rule (a pasted command MUST run as pasted): the exe token stays unquoted
whenever the path is plain; that form runs in Command Prompt, PowerShell, and batch
files, while a quoted first token flips PowerShell into expression mode. When the
path forces quotes (spaces), the shells diverge (PowerShell needs the `& ` call
operator, cmd rejects it), so the dialog shows TWO labeled copyable lines, one per
shell. The split is Windows-only: POSIX shells run a quoted first token, so
macOS/Linux always show one line.

## Trust model

Scripts run with the application's privileges, like Photoshop or Affinity scripts: the
sandbox is "only run scripts you trust", not a permission system. The engine exposes no
file, network, or process API beyond the documented `patchy.io` helpers (text files,
folder listing, single-file existence/size/delete, makeDir) and document save/export
paths. The single-instance
pipe is per-user, so `--run-script` adds no cross-user surface.

## Legal posture

- The API is Patchy's own design: generic OO naming, no Adobe ExtendScript identifiers,
  no cloned DOM, no copied documentation text. Keep it that way.
- Qt6Qml is LGPL and dynamically linked, the same posture as every other shipped Qt
  module. No vendored JS engine.

## Testing

- `tests/ui/scripting_tests.cpp` (`.\patchy_ui_visual_tests.exe ui_script`): the single
  undo entry, stale wrappers, pixel round trips and palette snap, timers, the watchdog
  (`PATCHY_SCRIPT_TIMEOUT_MS`), console line numbers, the CLI output file, the Script
  Manager and its C:\ dialog, the canvas window, the Scripts menu scan, the guide
  viewer, and `patchy.io` on Unicode paths (`ui_script_io_round_trips_unicode_path`).
  Layer moves live in `tests/ui/script_move_tests.cpp`.
- The engine works offscreen; `ScriptEngineHost::message_backlog()` is the easiest
  assertion surface (fresh per MainWindow).
- Manual smoke: every bundled script runs from File > Scripts and finishes unattended
  under `--run-script` (active-document scripts against a positional file;
  picker-driven ones take folders/files via `--script-arg`, and cancel cleanly without).

## Future work

Not built: document/save/command hooks with a reentrancy design, per-script hotkeys
with stable path-based IDs, persistent script storage, macro recording, non-blocking
batches, script packaging, and an editor REPL.

Anti-goals: never freeze or fork the API surface, no undocumented escape hatches
(test-driven additions go through the documented API too, per the AGENTS.md
scripting-for-testability rule), and scripts stay plain user-editable files.

Unattended dispatch covers scripts forwarded to an existing GUI.
RAW imports read `.rawprefs` sidecars or defaults without writing settings. PDF
imports use defaults. Dialogs return Cancel; modified documents remain
open unless the script explicitly calls `doc.close()`. Forms use their normal
widget normalization without showing. Menu Undo/Redo/Quit are rejected while the
script owns the transaction. The editor's syntax, gutter, and hover-card colors
use theme roles and refresh on scheme changes.
