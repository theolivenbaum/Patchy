# Merge Layers

`layer.merge_down` (Ctrl+E, Layer > Merge Down and the layer context menu) merges
selected layers, or the active layer with its lower sibling. A selected group
includes its contents. Ancestor selections include descendants only once.

Selections containing vectors use `src/ui/layer_merge.{hpp,cpp}`. Shapes that
produce one vector output merge immediately; groups and mixed selections open
**Merge Layers** with three appearance-preserving options:

- **Keep vector layers editable** preserves editable vector objects and
  merges bitmap runs separately (default on). Turn off to rasterize the merge.
- **Merge within each group separately** keeps folders and merges each folder's
  compatible children (default off). An ordinary all-vector folder in one paint
  category gets one vector child.
  Leave off to release selected ordinary Pass Through folders and merge across
  their boundaries. Groups with opacity, masks, effects or isolation retain
  their boundaries.
- **Separate merges for different vector types** separates solid, gradient,
  pattern and mixed-paint categories (default on). Colors, stroke widths,
  caps, joins and dashes do not split a category. Turn off to merge categories
  together while retaining every appearance.

All three options work together. The readout reports output leaf counts and
removed layers. Merge is disabled only when the choices cannot change anything.
Cancel leaves revisions, saved bytes, dirty state and history unchanged.
Bitmap-only Merge Down keeps its existing flattening behavior without a dialog.
When source layer effects require separate layers, the dialog lists those layers
and explains that turning off vector preservation rasterizes merged artwork.
The explanation also applies when every selected layer is a vector.

**Merge into one vector layer** explicitly combines the selected vectors even
when their layer effects or intervening unselected layers prevent a preserving
merge. It overrides the group and paint-category options. Each shape keeps its
fill, vector stroke, curves, live-shape annotations and paint placement.

- **Remove layer effects** discards the individual effect stacks (default).
- **Use effects from a layer** takes the complete stack from the selected source,
  including disabled instances and preserved native settings. Those effects apply
  once to the combined silhouette. It does not copy source opacity or blending.

The result replaces the bottommost selected vector in the layer stack. Selected
shapes keep their relative paint order; moving them past unselected layers can
change overlap. The dialog identifies that placement and reports stacking changes.
Its bounded preview shows the complete resulting artwork; unchecking **Preview**
shows the original. Changing the policy updates the preview before Merge becomes
available. Preview failure is reported; a preparation failure disables Merge.
Cancel never alters the document, including when a render is still running.

This mode requires at least two editable vectors and explains blockers by layer
name. Hidden or locked sources (including inherited locks/visibility), non-vector
content, separate masks, clipping relationships, Smart Filters, non-Normal blending,
Blend If, channel restrictions, preserved uneditable vector data, vector feather or
density, and compound outer opacity/Fill still require separate layers. A shared
enclosing group's effects/isolation remain intact. Moving shapes across a group
boundary requires an ordinary Pass Through group. Selected ordinary groups are
released; unselected folders remain. No source is silently omitted or rasterized.

**Merge Visible to New Layer (Copy)** (`layer.merge_visible`, Ctrl+Shift+E) copies
all effectively visible content, independent of selection. Visible vectors open
the same dialog, including the explicit single-vector mode. Copy remains available even
when its layers cannot be combined further. Multiple outputs form one new Normal
group. Hidden folders and children are excluded, including clipped artwork whose
base is hidden. Source locks protect the originals and do not block copying.
**Hide original layers** defaults on for vector copies to avoid drawing transparent
art twice; uncheck it to retain the originals' visibility. Originals retain their
content, properties and ids. Copied layers receive fresh document/native ids and
Smart Object instance/cache identities. One Undo restores the tree and visibility.
Bitmap-only copies create an RGBA snapshot without a dialog, preserving fully
transparent areas and partial coverage from pixels, masks and layer/group opacity.
Visible opaque backgrounds remain opaque. Source layers retain their visibility.
Copy rendering uses the same worker and delayed processing overlay as Merge Down;
preparation and resource duplication finish before undo and document mutation.

## Vector representation and editing

`core/vector_compound.{hpp,cpp}` owns merged vector objects. They remain real
Pixel-kind shape layers, with immutable `VectorShapeContent` and derived pixel
caches. An ordinary shape has no `parts`; a merged shape has ordered
`VectorShapePart` paints. Each part references group ids in the shared path and
retains its fill, stroke, opacity, fill opacity, whole-canvas/inverted/disabled
flags and pattern reference point. Holes and intersections execute independently
inside each part. No tracing or bitmap-to-vector conversion occurs.

Point editing continues to target the shared path. Deleting a part's last path
removes that paint, except for an intentional whole-canvas fill. Move and document
transforms update part anchors and stroke dimensions. Whole-layer appearance
edits change only edited fields across parts; unrelated colors and strokes stay
intact. Explicit Combine Shapes Boolean commands continue to use the bottom
shape's appearance. New Add shapes append a paint; other shape-area operations
apply the new path to each existing paint.

The deterministic native rasterizer bakes each part then composites its pixels
in paint order. Dynamic Vector Preview expands the parts into temporary native
vector nodes, using the existing bounded tiles, culling and memory budget.
Their tile composite becomes a temporary pixel layer before outer opacity,
Fill, masks, clipping and effects apply.
Unchanged canvas repaints do not rebuild this representation. Object-level styles
apply to the combined object. Source layers with styles stay separate unless the
explicit single-vector effect policy is chosen.

## Preservation boundaries

Adjacent selected vectors merge without changing paint order. Matching paint
categories can cross other selected vector runs only when conservative geometry
bounds, including stroke extents, do not overlap. Unselected layers, bitmaps and
retained groups remain ordering barriers. Layer-aligned gradients and differently
anchored patterns retain their own paint coordinates.

Hidden and locked layers remain intact. Clip bases and clipped siblings stay
separate, even when only part of a clipping stack is selected. Separate masks,
effects, advanced blending and unsupported imported vectors retain their source
layers. Text and Smart Objects stay editable. A merged vector object with a
subsequently changed opacity remains an isolation boundary when merging again.
Normal bitmap runs can merge; backdrop-dependent bitmap blending stays separate.
The explicit raster option uses the CPU compositor and honors image/group locks;
position-only Background locking permits merging as in ordinary Merge Down.

## PSD, SVG and PDF

A native PSD shape has one fill/stroke, so compound vector layers expand on save
into a Normal group containing native shape records. Other PSD readers see editable
vector children. Patchy restores one vector layer after native vectors/patterns load.
PSD/PSB saves enforce Photoshop's 8000 native-record limit after expansion,
including hidden originals and group boundaries. A merged vector copy plus its
complete original artwork can exceed that limit even with few visible layers;
the save fails without discarding either copy. Saving only the desired copy or
explicitly rasterizing some artwork reduces the native record count.

Associations use image resource **4211**, in Adobe's plug-in resource range, with
big-endian payload `PtcV`, u16 version 1, u16 reserved 0, u32 count, then count pairs
`{u32 native lyid, u32 role}`. Roles are 1 for compound content, 2 for the inner
Fill-opacity boundary, and 3 for [open-stroke compatibility groups](open-path-strokes.md).
The writer assigns missing or ambiguous native ids on its
temporary document. The bounded reader validates the entire payload; duplicate ids,
missing groups and unsupported versions cannot fold arbitrary layers. Other editors
may preserve the resource without interpreting it. Ordinary PSD bytes remain unchanged.

The old per-layer `pvcl` and `pvfi` tags (`PVCL` + big-endian u32 version 1) remain
readable and serve as runtime annotations. They are **never emitted**: Photoshop
warns about unknown per-layer keys. Saving a legacy merged file migrates its markers
to resource 4211. A foreign editor's unrepresentable child changes preserve native
groups rather than losing artwork. A changed Fill opacity uses an inner Normal
group (chosen when folders were believed to ignore Fill; see ps-compat.md). Object-level styles follow native group
semantics in other PSD readers.

Native live-shape annotations follow remapped group ids. Unmodeled Custom live
annotations cannot follow reassigned indices and are dropped during merging;
the editable curves remain. The existing writer omits incomplete live annotation
sets. Unparsed vector blocks remain on untouched layers. Pattern resources stay
in the document and follow the existing PSD embedding rules.

SVG and editable PDF exports expand compound parts into native vector groups
before their existing format-specific support checks. Flat exports use the
normal pixel composite. Serialization and exports never mutate the source.

## Transaction, feedback and automation

Planning reads const data and never bakes pixels. The non-modal dialog reads a
copy-on-write snapshot under the edit lock. Output preparation completes before
one Undo snapshot; any failed operation leaves the original document intact.
Native vector and bitmap merging run expensive rendering on background workers.
The existing delayed **Merging layers...** processing overlay animates during
slow work, and disappears when it completes. Session identity is checked before
applying the prepared result. Undo and Redo restore the complete tree.
The single-vector dialog coalesces background work with generation checks and
publishes only the latest completed document/preview pair. Closing invalidates
pending results; tracked workers own immutable snapshots. Acceptance reuses the
prepared document and raster caches instead of rendering the same merge again.

`doc.mergeLayers(layers, options?)` exposes the same planner without a dialog.
Boolean options `keepVectors`, `withinGroups`, `separateVectorTypes` default to
true, false, true. It returns surviving selected leaf wrappers bottom-to-top.
`singleVector: true` overrides those options and performs the explicit vector
merge above. Omit `effectsFrom` to remove effects, or pass a selected vector's
layer wrapper to use its stack. `effectsFrom` requires `singleVector`; a foreign,
missing or unselected source throws. Any single-vector blocker throws before
mutation, with the same reasons as the dialog.
A single leaf does not imply its lower sibling. Invalid or foreign wrappers and
invalid options throw before mutation. A no-op adds no history. Scripts use the
host's existing progress and cancellation lifecycle. `getShape().parts` exposes
read-only part appearances and group references. API version remains 1.

Tests in `tests/ui/layer_merge_tests.cpp` cover the three-option combination,
colors/strokes, holes/inversion, paint placement, ordering barriers, processing,
transforms, PSD/PSB reopening, dialog cancellation, history and scripting. Explicit
vector-mode cases cover heterogeneous paints, live geometry, effect-stack transfer
and removal, nonadjacent placement, group boundaries, blocker diagnostics, latest
preview publication, preview-off and cancellation during work. Bitmap-copy
tests cover transparent and opaque backgrounds, masks, group opacity, an entirely
transparent canvas, unchanged sources and Undo/Redo. The
optional ignored Little-Everywhere fixture verifies one vector child per folder,
normal and zoomed images, output counts, and large Shift-selection timing.
