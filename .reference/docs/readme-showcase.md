# Rebuilding the README showcase

The README uses a hero image and six feature captures. The [full gallery](screenshots.md)
keeps the other examples. Every capture has a script or a `shot_readme_*` scene;
do not replace one with a manually arranged desktop screenshot.

From the repository root on Windows:

```powershell
# Build the screenshot targets and regenerate the regular gallery.
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/make-readme-screenshots.ps1

# Include the locally installed commercial KPT fixture.
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/make-readme-screenshots.ps1 -IncludeLegacyPlugins

# Rebuild one capture using the current release binaries.
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/make-readme-screenshots.ps1 -SkipBuild -Scene long_shadow
```

The driver accepts image base names or full `shot_readme_*` names. `-Scene hero`
regenerates `smart_filters.png`, which the README uses directly. Missing local
fixtures are reported as skips during a full run; an explicitly selected script
scene fails if its fixture is missing. KPT runs only with `-IncludeLegacyPlugins`
or `-Scene plugin_kpt5`. It requires the Windows 32-bit legacy helper.

| Image | Recipe | Input |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `smart_filters.png` (hero) | `shot_readme_smart_filters` | `local-test-fixtures/psd/akiko_cycling_okinawa.jpg`, grouped captions, clipping, a Levels adjustment, and color controls |
| `layer_styles.png` | `shot_readme_layer_styles` | `local-test-fixtures/psd/ipad_main_v04.psd`, live layer styles and gradient color controls |
| `plugin_kpt5.png` | `scripts/dev/readme-shots/plugin-kpt5.js` | Licensed KPT 5 fixture and the existing CC0 city photograph |
| `smart_objects.png` | `shot_readme_smart_objects` | Local PSD fixtures used by the existing scene |
| `vector_tools.png` | `shot_readme_vector_tools` | Generated vector artwork with gradient fill, rounded corners, and a dashed pattern stroke |
| `warp_text.png` | `shot_readme_warp_text` | Generated editable type; Japanese-capable font required |
| `tilt_shift.png` | `shot_readme_tilt_shift` | `test-fixtures/readme/san_francisco_cityscape_cc0.jpg` |
| `long_shadow.png` (gallery only) | `shot_readme_long_shadow` | Generated editable type and live continuous shadows; no external artwork |

Offscreen recipes live in `tests/ui/readme_screenshot_tests_*.cpp`. They create
real Patchy documents, arrange the UI, and capture the widgets. The long-shadow
scene opens the actual Layer Style dialog and checks its Continuous setting.
Its typography uses a live continuous shadow, not a painted imitation.

The hero shows rulers and keeps the native three-filter stack and shared mask on the photograph.
The mask protects the cyclist's face and applies the blur stack to the surroundings.
The color picker shows its wheel and palette, while a real Levels adjustment layer
is open for editing with its histogram and live preview. Neutral Levels settings
preserve the photograph; the scene checks the face pixels against the source.
An expanded Ride notes group contains two editable text layers, a rounded caption
card, and a color wash clipped to that card. The vector scene combines pen paths
and anchor editing with gradient paint, a dashed pattern stroke, and rounded corners.

The separate Levels, brush-dynamics, shape-appearance, and Affinity images are retired
from the gallery. Their existing scenes remain regression coverage; the driver
does not publish those artifacts. Brush dynamics are described with brush tips.
Long Shadow remains in the gallery; the README's six feature cards use Layer Styles instead.

The text showcase combines a live Warp Text preview with three warped words,
a single boxed paragraph containing bold, italic, colored, and mixed-font runs,
a tracked heading, and two Japanese vertical columns. The sample reads
"Let's play with letters / Let's enjoy color." Every sample is an editable
type layer. The scene registers its Latin and Japanese test fonts and reports
a skip if no Japanese family is available; it never publishes missing-glyph boxes.

The KPT recipe uses `local-test-fixtures/photoshop-plugins/kpt5/KPT5_Files/KPT5`.
Keep the commercial binaries, presets, manuals, and generated state gitignored.
Follow the fixture scan and first-run requirements in [plugins.md](plugins.md).
The driver copies the fixture and a portable Patchy host into its task-owned
scratch directory, isolating both Patchy's settings and KPT's writable state.
An installed copy of KPT cannot override that fixture through duplicate IDs.

The KPT recipe pins its virtual screen to 1024 x 768, allows five seconds for the
preview to settle, then uses the runner's targeted `30,30` acceptance click.
No global cursor movement or keyboard input is involved.

The KPT picture combines two direct window captures: `patchy.ui.captureWindow`
for Patchy and `layer.applyPlugin(..., {dialog: true, captureDialog: ...})` for
the framed plug-in. The driver scales and positions the plug-in capture over
Patchy. This is a presentation layout, not a claim about physical window
positions. It never captures the desktop or crops a desktop screenshot.

Raw captures and script logs stay under `build/release/readme-shot-*`. A failed
script run leaves the last published image intact. The driver uses isolated
settings, a separate process, pinned 96-DPI geometry, and bounded plug-in windows.
Only task-owned processes may be stopped after a timeout. Never close a user's
documents or attach this capture workflow to an unrelated running instance.

See [testing.md](testing.md#readme-screenshots) for capture conventions, fixture
requirements, and the separate Mehdi plug-in recipe. The photograph's source and
license are recorded in [NOTICE-THIRD-PARTY.md](../NOTICE-THIRD-PARTY.md).
