# Automatic document recovery and atomic file writes

Read this before touching the recovery timer, the recovery store, the startup reopen, the
Preferences row, `patchy.recovery`, or any file writer.

## What the user sees

Patchy writes a copy of every modified document to a recovery folder on a timer, the way
Photoshop's "Automatically Save Recovery Information Every N minutes" does. The user's own
file is never touched. When Patchy quits normally the copies are deleted. When it crashes
(or is killed, or the machine loses power), the next interactive launch reopens every copy
as a modified document titled `<name> (Recovered)` (or `Untitled (Recovered)`), with its
path set to the original file when it had one, so Save goes back where the user expects.
No prompt: Photoshop reopens silently too, and a recovered document is just an unsaved
document the user can close.

Preferences > Application: "Automatically save recovery information every" with a
5/10/15/30/60 minute combo. On by default at 10 minutes.

## Trigger rule

- Time-based only. The timer (`documentRecoveryTimer`, a `Qt::VeryCoarseTimer`) fires
  every `recovery/intervalMinutes`; there is no action count (one brush stroke and one
  Liquify session are both "one action").
- A session is written only if it is modified (`session_is_modified`) and its
  `(revision, current_state_id)` pair differs from the pair its current copy holds
  (`recovery_marks_`). `revision` alone is not monotonic: `rotate_history_state` restores
  the old value on undo, and the next edit after an undo reuses the number. The state id
  is minted fresh per history push and only ever goes back through undo/redo, so the pair
  identifies a distinct document state (scripts with `app.undoEnabled = false` bump only
  the revision, still covered).
- A tick is skipped entirely when the app is busy: `QApplication::activeModalWidget()`,
  the preview-dialog edit lock, or `any_canvas_interaction_active()` (pointer gesture,
  Free Transform, warp, path transform, crop session, inline text editor; the same
  predicate the scripting host's `manual_edit_in_progress` uses), or when a previous
  write is still in flight. One write job runs at a time.
- Export, run-script, headless, and hidden-connector instances (`cli_automation_mode_`)
  never tick. `patchy.recovery.writeNow()` ignores that gate so a script can drive it.

## The write

`MainWindow::write_recovery_now` (src/ui/main_window_recovery.cpp) snapshots each
candidate session on the UI thread (a `Document` copy shares pixel storage copy-on-write;
the live side detaches on its next edit, the worker only reads through `const Document&`),
then one `run_tracked_background_worker` job writes them in sequence:
`psd::DocumentIo::write_layered_rgb8(snapshot, WriteOptions{true})` (PSB, so any size fits)
and `recovery::write_entry`. Completion posts back through a queued `invokeMethod` on the
application with a `QPointer<MainWindow>`; `finish_recovery_write` stores the marks, and
removes the copy of any session that was closed or saved during the write (its close or
save already removed the previous copy, so the fresh one must not resurrect it). Errors go
to the status bar once, never a modal. `main()` waits for tracked workers before the
application object dies, so a quit mid-write never leaves a half-written file. The
snapshots are released on the worker, and `history_retained_bytes()` deliberately does not
count them (worst case one extra full copy, the same as an undo state).

## On disk

`<root>/<pid>-<start ms>/` per running instance, where `<root>` is
`PATCHY_RECOVERY_DIR` when set, else `<QStandardPaths::AppDataLocation>/AutoRecover`
(`%APPDATA%\RTsoft\Patchy\AutoRecover` on Windows). The folder is created by the first
write, never by construction, so an instance that never wrote leaves nothing behind.

Inside, per session (Qt-free layout in `src/core/document_recovery_store.hpp`):

- `<session_id>.psb`: the copy.
- `<session_id>.recovery`: UTF-8 `key=value` lines `title=`, `path=` (the original file as
  UTF-8, empty when never saved), `savedAt=` (Unix ms). Key=value rather than JSON because
  `patchy_core` has no JSON parser and titles and paths cannot contain newlines. The PSB
  is written first and the sidecar second, so a crash between them leaves a recoverable
  document listed as untitled, never a sidecar pointing at nothing.
- `lock`: a `QLockFile` with `setStaleLockTime(0)`. Liveness comes from Qt's own check that
  the pid in the file is a running process; the age heuristic is disabled because a live
  instance older than 30 seconds would otherwise look stale and a second instance would
  recover its documents out from under it.

Both files are written through `write_file_bytes_atomically`.

## Lifecycle

- `set_session_saved` (a successful save) and `close_document_session` (after the
  save-changes decision) call `discard_recovery_for_session`: the copy and its mark go.
- An accepted `closeEvent` stops the timer. `~MainWindow` stops it and calls
  `RecoveryInstanceFolder::discard_on_release`: the folder is deleted by whichever owner
  releases the shared pointer last, the window or a still-running write. A crash never
  reaches the destructor, which is the whole point. One quit path skips the destructor
  on purpose: when a tracked worker is still blocked in the OS 10 s after the event loop
  returned, `main.cpp` calls `discard_recovery_folder_for_forced_exit` (timer stopped,
  entries deleted; on Windows the open lock file survives as a lock-only folder that the
  next start sweeps) and ends the process without destructors.
- Startup (`src/app/main.cpp`, interactive path only, not stress/export/run-script/
  screenshot/headless): `recover_orphaned_documents()` before the command-line files open.
  Orphans are folders under the root whose lock is missing or names a dead process
  (`RecoveryInstanceFolder::scan_orphaned`; empty orphan folders are swept). Every entry
  opens through `open_recovered_document` (the regular `load_document_interactive` path
  with prompts off, plus the reopened-text metric fix-up), becomes a modified session, and
  its two files are renamed into this instance's folder under the new session id with a
  mark equal to the session's current state (a second crash is covered; the timer does not
  rewrite an identical copy). A file that fails to open stays where it is and the status
  bar reports the count. `patchy-mcp` with a visible workspace runs the timer like the GUI;
  hidden connectors do not.
- Concurrent instances are real (`PATCHY_NO_SINGLE_INSTANCE`, the test binaries, the
  connector), which is why liveness is per folder and never "files exist".
- wasm: compiled out (`Q_OS_WASM`). MEMFS is recreated per page load, so there is nothing
  durable to recover from. No Preferences row, no timer; `patchy.recovery.enabled` is false
  and every list is empty.

## Settings and environment

- `recovery/enabled` (bool, default true) and `recovery/intervalMinutes` (int, default 10,
  normalized to `kRecoveryIntervalMinutes`), through the accessors in
  `src/ui/app_settings.hpp`. Both keys are compatibility contracts.
- `PATCHY_RECOVERY_DIR` (the root; the UI suite sets `test-artifacts/recovery` so test
  windows never touch the user's store) and `PATCHY_RECOVERY_INTERVAL_MS` (timer override
  for tests).

## Scripting

`patchy.recovery`: `enabled`, `intervalMinutes` (throws outside the step list), `directory`,
`writeNow()`, `listFiles()`, `listOrphaned()`, `recoverAll()`, `discardOrphaned()`.
Documented in `scripts/bundled/patchy.d.ts`, `scripts/bundled/scripting-guide.md`, and
`docs/scripting-api-changes.md`. It exists so the tests below drive the real code path
instead of test-only hooks.

## Atomic file writes

`write_file_bytes_atomically(path, bytes, open_message, write_message)` in
`src/support/atomic_file_write.hpp` writes `<name>.<pid>-<counter>.patchy-tmp` beside the
target, flushes, and renames it over the target (MSVC's `rename` is `MoveFileExW` with
`MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING`; POSIX `rename` replaces). The temporary file is removed on
every failure path. Callers: `psd::write_file_bytes` (every PSD/PSB write; it used to skip
the write check entirely), `formats::write_file_bytes` (BMP, TGA, PCX, ICO, ILBM, Aseprite,
GIF, JPEG XR, SVG, RTTEX), and the recovery store. `write_flat_image_file`
(PNG, JPEG, WebP, TIFF and the other `QImageWriter` formats) goes through `QSaveFile` with
an explicit format instead, since `QImageWriter` on a device cannot infer it from a suffix.
The PDF writers (`QPdfWriter(path)` and the image-page writer) still write in place.

Semantics that changed on purpose: a target another process holds open with a share-deny
lock (Windows) now fails at the rename and reports "Could not write", where the old
truncating open sometimes succeeded and destroyed the file; a symlink target is replaced by
a regular file; the new file takes the directory's default permissions rather than the old
file's. The byte canaries pin encoder bytes, not the write path, and are unaffected.

## Tests

Core (`patchy_core_tests`, filters `atomic_write` and `recovery`; group
`atomic_write_recovery_tests`): replace-existing with no temporary left, missing directory
throws and keeps nothing, failed rename keeps the target and removes the temporary, sidecar
round trip with Unicode and CRLF input, directory scan with strays, Unicode instance root.

UI (`patchy_ui_visual_tests`, filters `ui_recovery`, `ui_flat_save`, `ui_preferences_recovery`;
group `document_recovery_tests`): `writeNow` round trip through the PSB reader and the
sidecar, the `(revision, state_id)` rule across undo/redo/edit, discard on save and on close,
the modal-dialog busy skip and the enabled toggle on a 50 ms timer, orphan detection through
a dead-pid lock and `recoverAll`, a live instance's folder never reported, Unicode roots and
titles, the atomic flat and PSD save (overwrite leaves no temporary, a missing folder fails
and keeps the old files), and the Preferences row plus the scripting setters.
