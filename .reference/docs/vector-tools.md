## Shape tools (Line / Rectangle / Ellipse)

Shape | Path | Pixels persists as `tools/vectorToolMode` (default Shape).
Shape drags preview options-bar fill/stroke at draw time
for the Content target; mask/channel/quick-mask targets always rasterize.
Release creates a shape layer from live parameters (rect, rounded rect via
Radius, ellipse, line with Weight) and the options-bar paints. Stroke
alignment defaults to Inside, like PS. Combine (New Layer / Add / Subtract /
Intersect / Exclude) appends a group with that op to the active shape layer.
Path mode appends the same subpaths to the work path; Pixels keeps the legacy
raster commit byte-identical.

Fill/Stroke popups (No Fill / Solid / Gradient / Pattern) use app-wide
`VectorFill` mirrors. Gradient picks resolve FG/BG stops immediately; patterns
enter the document store at commit (`ensure_vector_fill_patterns`, honoring
the Patt-block refusal below). Kind and preset ids persist under
vectorFill*/vectorStrokePaint* keys; gradient/pattern PLACEMENT resets each
launch. Selected shapes share property edits and corner radii, with mixed-value
markers and one undo per gesture; see [batch appearance](batch-appearance.md).
The controls also serve Path Select / Direct Select and next-shape defaults.
Stroke controls remain enabled when any eligible target has a stroke.
Appearance... ends the row. Position and size edits require one selected layer.

A bare click (no drag) with Rectangle, Ellipse, Polygon, or Custom Shape
opens the Create <Shape> dialog (shape_create_dialog.cpp): Width, Height,
From Center (the click is the top-left corner, else the center), and
per-corner radii for rectangles prefilled from the options-bar Radius. The
result commits exactly like a drag (mode routing, Combine, vector-mask
target, naming) through `commit_live_shape` / `handle_vector_path_committed`;
values are remembered per tool for the session. The click test is a release on
the press's own document pixel; any real extent commits as a drag. Line has
no dialog (Photoshop has none), a Fixed Size style click still places its
W x H, and Pixels mode keeps its legacy click. The options-bar W / H spins
(`vectorShapeWidthSpin`/`vectorShapeHeightSpin`, link button for proportional
edits) mirror the active shape layer's path bounds: shape tools show them in
Shape mode only (disabled until a shape layer is active), Path Select /
Direct Select and Move only with an editable shape layer
(`ui_shape_size_row_shows_in_shape_mode_only`). A debounced edit scales the
shape about its top-left through `transform_layer_vector_data` (live shapes
stay live; one "Shape size" undo per edit). The Properties panel repeats the
row (`propertiesShapeSizePanel`, one line) for an active
editable shape layer; both share
`handle_vector_shape_size_value_changed`
(`ui_shape_size_controls_follow_move_and_properties_selection`).

## Pen tool

Pen (P): click adds a corner, drag pulls symmetric handles (Alt breaks the pair), clicking
the first anchor closes and commits, Enter commits the open path (it fills
its implied chord, the PS open-subpath rule), Backspace pops the last
anchor, Escape cancels; tool switches commit, document switches cancel.
Shape mode turns the committed path into a shape layer (or extends the
active one per Combine); other modes route to the work path. The overlay
draws in canvas_widget_vector_tools.cpp (canvas_widget_pen.cpp is TABLET
input, not this tool).

A badge crosshair cursor shows the click action (insert/delete/convert/
close); one classifier (`pen_hover_hit_raw`, narrowed per tool and by the
Auto Add/Delete option) drives cursor, click editor, and right-click menu
([vector-commands.md](vector-commands.md)). Holding Ctrl acts as Direct
Select: with no session it latches the gesture onto the path-edit handlers
(one "Edit path" undo entry); mid-session it drags an in-progress anchor
without adding one. Ctrl clicks never insert, delete, close, or extend;
Delete removes a Ctrl-selected anchor.

## Polygon, Custom Shape, and line arrowheads

Polygon drags center-out with Sides and a Star inset percent (0 = plain);
Custom Shape stamps a library shape into the drag rect (Shift keeps it
square). Both are vector-only: the combo greys out Pixels (and the Pen) and
shows the effective mode (Path) without changing it. They write plain paths
(PS's polygon/custom origination descriptors: unprobed). The Line tool gains
arrow start/end checkboxes (head width 5x, length 10x the weight, PS's
proportions) encoded through the probed keyOriginLine arrow keys. The
CustomShapeLibrary (JSON sidecars under settings/shapes, unit-box paths, v1
text codec) ships 17 builtins: ids shape.builtin.* are append-only, geometry
is code-authoritative (restore_default_shapes rewrites drifted builtin
sidecars, keeping user renames). Edit > Define Custom Shape from Path adds a
user entry.

## Path editing (Path Select / Direct Select)

Path Select (A, black arrow) selects and drags whole shape groups. Direct
Select (Shift+A from the Path Select tool, white arrow) works per anchor: click or marquee selects,
drag moves anchors or handle knobs (smooth pairs mirror; a collapsed handle
on its corner anchor is not grabbable), Shift adds, arrows nudge (1 px,
Shift 10 px, coalesced per burst), Delete removes selected anchors (subpaths
under two anchors disappear), Escape deselects. With a selection, the
options-bar Combine box rewrites the selected shapes' op in place. The Pen
doubles as the point editor: click a segment to insert an anchor (exact de
Casteljau split), click an anchor to delete it, Alt+click toggles
corner/smooth. Any direct edit drops the touched groups' live-shape
annotations (PS's keyShapeInvalidated rule) and re-rasterizes; the target is
the active shape layer, else the work path.

## Vector mask UI

Layers with a vector mask get a third row thumbnail (grayscale coverage,
density and disabled-cross conventions). Click targets the mask path for
pen/path tools (raster painting refuses), Ctrl-click loads the coverage as a
selection, Alt-click toggles the grayscale view, Shift-click disables.
Layer > Vector Mask: Reveal All (empty path = full coverage), Hide All
(inverted empty path), Current Path (copies the work path), Delete,
Disable, Rasterize (bakes coverage, density and any raster mask multiplied
in, into the layer mask). While the vector-mask target is active, shape
drags and pen commits append subpaths to the mask path.

## Paths panel

Tabs with Channels. Rows: saved paths (filled coverage thumbnails so
boolean holes read, 1 px outline), the work path (italic, last), and a
transient row for the active layer's shape or vector-mask path. Selecting a
row targets it for pen/path tools (outranking the layer/work-path fallback);
empty-space click deselects. Double-click saves the work path: inline
rename, row moves to the END (DocumentPath::set_kind drops the stale 1025
source so the writer allocates a saved-range id;
psd_work_path_saved_as_named_round_trips). Ctrl-click (Cmd on macOS) loads
a row's path as a selection without changing targeting; Ctrl+Enter on the
CANVAS does the same for the targeted row (a canvas key, not a shortcut).

Saved rows drag-reorder among themselves (frame-breaking drops revert); the
writer assigns the sorted saved-range id set by document order so reorders
round-trip with verbatim payloads (psd_saved_paths_reorder_round_trips).
Writer invariants: new paths allocate ABOVE the highest stored id, ids
outside 2000..2997 never enter the saved set, path-range entries normalize
to ascending id order after upserts.

While any row is selected its outline draws with EVERY tool;
anchors/handles stay path-tool-only. A layer-owned outline follows its
layer's Move drag or Free Transform preview
([interactive-previews.md](interactive-previews.md)). Under a path tool the
overlay also outlines every Layers-panel-selected shape layer with hollow
anchors (`set_panel_selected_layer_ids`, pushed from
`refresh_layer_controls`); only the target path gets filled anchors,
handles, and edits. View > Show Target Path (Ctrl+Shift+H, view.target_path)
hides the overlay without touching targeting (not persisted; a
path-transform session always draws its box). Ctrl+H (view.selection_edges,
PS's Extras toggle) hides it with the selection edges; a new selection
re-shows both (ui_ctrl_h_hides_path_points_with_selection_edges).
Canvas-side edits refresh rows and thumbnails live. The context menu's
Clipping Path entry designates ONE saved path as the document clipping path
(resource 2999; name underlines; exclusive). Work-path draws and layer
activation auto-select/target their rows; activating a layer with its own
path drops a stale work/saved-path target (vector-commands.md). Dismissal
(empty click, or Escape once no anchor is selected) sticks per layer until
the layer changes, the row is re-clicked, or a new drag commits; a path tool
still draws its edit-target fallback afterward.

Footer commands (row commands need a selected row; the panel refreshes on
selectionChanged AND currentItemChanged;
ui_paths_panel_actions_follow_row_selection pins it):

- New Path: empty, immediately targeted.
- Fill Path: persisted dialog; FG/BG color or a PATTERN with
  Scale/Angle/Offset/Align-with-layer rows (shared PatternTileSampler; Align
  anchors at the layer's effects reference point) plus opacity; raster-only; palette mode
  snaps via snap_pixel_to_palette.
- Stroke Path: replays the flattened path through the BRUSH ENGINE as
  synthetic input (one "Stroke path" undo); Simulate Pressure sends tablet
  events with a sine taper; open subpaths get no implied chord.
- Make Selection: feather (triple box blur), anti-alias, combine ops.
- Make Work Path from Selection: tolerance 0.5-10 px (persisted); traces
  the hard selection, fits via core/path_fit (Douglas-Peucker corners +
  Schneider cubics); outer loops Add, holes Subtract.
- Delete Path; Duplicate Path in the row context menu ("<name> copy").

## Geometry operations

Document-geometry ops transform the vector data with the pixels and
re-rasterize at the new canvas: Image Size scales anchors and stroke width,
Canvas Size/crop translate (canvas-relative PSD records need this),
90-degree rotates map edge coordinates, per-layer flips mirror about the
pixel-bounds center. Free Transform applies its affine delta to the path
model and re-rasterizes (no resampling); Move translates the model. Stroke
width never scales and the box hugs the ink, so the path maps onto the box
inset by the stroke overhang (`shape_free_transform_delta`); the drag
preview still stretches the stroke. Live-shape annotations survive positive
axis-aligned scale + translate and drop otherwise (keyShapeInvalidated
rule). Saved and work paths ride document ops. Warp refuses on vector layers.

## Appearance editing and fill layers

The Shape Appearance dialog opens from the vector badge, the layer context
menu (a shape row's double-click opens Layer Style, like every row), the
canvas right-click menu's shape section ([tools.md](tools.md)), the
options-bar Appearance... button (Shape mode, or Path / Direct Select on an
editable shape), Layer > Shape > Shape Appearance... (`layer.shape_appearance`),
the Properties panel's Edit Appearance... button, and a Path Select / Direct
Select double-click on the shape's geometry. Reset restores the factory
appearance, fill in the foreground color (geometry stays). Controls: paint kind,
width, alignment, caps, joins, dash presets (Custom keeps PSD dash arrays).
`pattern_linked` anchors at the effects reference point when on and document
origin when off; offsets add either way (PatternTileSampler).

Geometry requires one modeled origination covering every subpath: rect bounds
and radii, ellipse bounds, or line endpoints/weight. A radius makes a rect rounded.
Chain buttons bracket their linked rows between labels and fields:
`shapeGeometryLinkButton` keeps W/H in the ratio captured when switched on;
`shapeGeometryRadiusLinkButton` edits all four radii together, on by default
only when the corners agree. generate_live_shape_subpaths keeps live
parameters. Dialogs are the patent-cleared route; on-canvas gizmos stay
excluded. It also edits layer Opacity and Fill opacity, the stroke's own
opacity (vstk strokeStyleOpacity), and Feather / Density (Edge group); all
PSD-native, one "Shape appearance" undo entry.

Edits preview live and restore on cancel or exception; a PSD-read
gradient/pattern stroke stays untouched unless re-picked. The preview
rasterizes on a worker: the vector MODEL applies synchronously, baked pixels
lag, requests coalesce, the pattern anchor rides a scratch layer; accept
commits the in-flight result (60s timeout fallback). Layer > New Fill Layer
creates Solid Color, Gradient (FG-to-BG linear), and Pattern fill layers as
shape layers with an empty path (whole canvas); a TARGETED Paths-panel row
becomes the new layer's shape path (PS's "current path" rule,
build_fill_layer), and selections become raster masks. Library patterns
adopt into the document store on use.

New Gradient/Pattern Fill stages the layer; one history entry, only on OK.
Cancel restores the original document, active layer and pattern store
included. Changing a path transform's layer, selection, path, or edit
target cancels it. Sub-lattice dash lengths clamp to the raster lattice;
excessive boundary counts fall back to a solid stroke.

## Photoshop file encodings (observed, PS 27.8 / July 2026)

Codec: src/psd/psd_vector.cpp (vmsk/vsms, SoCo/GdFl/PtFl, vstk, vogk, path
resources); model: src/core/vector_shape.hpp.

### Shape and fill layer structure

- A shape layer is an ordinary layer record carrying a fill content block
  (`SoCo` solid / `GdFl` gradient / `PtFl` pattern) plus a `vmsk` vector
  mask block; live shapes add `vogk` (+ a 4-byte `vowv` = u32 2 beside it;
  PS wrote vowv for rect and line kinds but not ellipse); stroked shapes add
  `vstk`.
- **Two hard open-refusal rules** (byte bisection with COM open tests; the
  rule text and regression-test names live in ps-compat.md):
  1. Every `PtFl` fill or `vstk` stroke pattern id MUST resolve in the file's
     `Patt`/`Pat2`/`Pat3`. `collect_referenced_pattern_ids` collects vector
     and style ids; missing tiles get 1x1 transparent placeholders.
     `PatternStore::adopt` heals placeholders on re-pick.
  2. Partial `vogk` group coverage is rejected. `origination_covers_path_groups`
     gates writing vogk/vowv; import drops partial blocks. Resaves use PS's
     plain-path fallback.
- Color channels are EMPTY: bounds (0,0,0,0), 2-byte compression markers
  including transparency -1. Readers rasterize vectors; writer:
  src/psd/psd_layer_records.cpp. Raster masks retain their own channels.
- Layer record flags: bit 3 + **bit 4** (0x18). Bit 4 = "pixel data
  irrelevant"; write it on shape/fill layers.
- `lnsr` = 'cont' for content layers ('bgnd' for Background). PS names:
  "Color Fill 1" (path-created), "Rectangle 1", "Ellipse 1", "Line 1".
- A plain fill layer is the same structure with an empty or absent `vmsk`.
- `vscg`: content key (SoCo/GdFl/PtFl, 4 bytes), descriptorVersion 16, paint.
  Without a fill block, vstk `fillEnabled=true` uses this paint as FILL,
  independent of stroke paint. Otherwise Fill is None; vscg supplies stroke
  paint only when vstk lacks strokeStyleContent. Untouched vscg/vmsk/vsms
  stay verbatim. Edits write SoCo/GdFl/PtFl + vstk + vmsk, retaining gradient
  settings and unmodeled paint fields. Missing vstk/path or unparseable
  required paint locks as "unparsed". Tests: `psd_legacy_vscg_*`.

### vmsk / vsms (vector mask path)

- Payload: u32 version = 3, u32 flags (bit 0 invert, bit 1 not-linked, bit 2
  disabled), then 26-byte path records, padded to even length. `vsms` is a
  legacy alternate (same payload; PS 27.8 writes `vmsk`): read both,
  write vmsk.
- Record order: one selector-6 record (fill rule; observed all zeros), one
  selector-8 record (initial fill; u16 observed 0), then per subpath a
  length record followed by its knot records.
- Length record (selector 0 = closed, 3 = open), after the u16 selector: u16
  knot count; u16 combine op (**0 = xor, 1 = add/union, 2 = subtract,
  3 = intersect**); u16 fill-rule field (+6); 4 zero bytes; u32 shape-group
  index (0,1,2,... in file order; ties the group to its `vogk`
  keyOriginIndex); 10 zero bytes.
- **Compound groups** (several contours sharing one group index: a donut,
  Convert to Shape glyphs, custom-shape stamps; pinned 2026-09-26 by
  byte-patched probes, PS 2026): the group's LEAD record carries the op and
  the +6 field (1 = fill the group even-odd, 2 = nonzero winding; PS's own
  compound shapes write 2); every CONTINUATION record carries op 0xFFFF and
  +6 field 0. A continuation written with its own op and +6 field 1 is a
  separate united contour: PS filled Patchy's donuts solid. The writer
  emits the continuation form for any subpath sharing the previous
  subpath's `shape_group` (lead: its op, +6 = 1, matching the renderer's
  even-odd group rule); the reader gives a 0xFFFF continuation its lead's
  op. PS resaves the +6 = 1 lead unchanged. Nonzero is not modeled: an
  untouched +6 = 2 layer re-emits verbatim, an edited one regenerates as
  even-odd (differs only for same-winding nested contours). Fixtures:
  [vector-fixtures.md](vector-fixtures.md).
- CS4-era files use the same grammar: leads op 1 / +6 = 2, cutouts UNSET
  (0xFFFF, +6 field 0), group index 0 on every record (Flat-filter-list.psd).
  A 0xFFFF record whose group differs from the previous record's maps to
  xor (parity fill). Pinned by
  `psd_legacy_vmsk_unset_combine_op_fills_by_parity`; real-file coverage
  rides `psd_16_bit_flat_filter_list_loads_if_available`.
- Knot records: selector 1 (closed smooth/linked), 2 (closed corner), 4
  (open smooth), 5 (open corner). Three coordinate pairs, each (y then x),
  each value i32 8.24 fixed point as a FRACTION of the canvas dimension
  (y/height, x/width). Pair order: **control toward the PREVIOUS anchor
  (in), then the anchor, then the control toward the NEXT anchor (out)**,
  pinned numerically against PS's live-ellipse knots and a
  rule-distinguishing donut render. Corner knots store all three pairs equal
  when no handles.

### Render semantics (pinned by fixture BMPs)

Implemented by src/core/vector_raster.hpp:

- Within one subpath the fill rule is EVEN-ODD (pentagram center hollow).
- Subpaths combine SEQUENTIALLY by their op over accumulated coverage:
  add = union, subtract = remove, intersect = keep common, xor = toggle. Ops
  act between subpath groups; coverage does not even-odd across groups
  (overlap of two add rects stays filled).
- First-subpath op: Subtract first = full canvas minus the shape
  (accumulator starts full); Add/Intersect/Xor first = exactly the shape.
- Open subpaths fill their implied closing chord. An empty path means "cover
  everything" (the fill-layer rule).
- Contours sharing one group index fill EVEN-ODD together (pinned by
  `patchy-compound-group.bmp`: holes for same- and opposite-winding inner
  contours, inner-first order, and a nested island).

### SoCo / GdFl / PtFl (fill content)

All are u32 descriptorVersion 16 + a descriptor with class `null`:

- `SoCo`: `Clr ` object, class `RGBC`, keys `Rd  `/`Grn `/`Bl  ` doubles.
- `GdFl` (defaults omitted; captured non-default set):
  `gradientsInterpolationMethod` enum
  `gradientInterpolationMethodType`=`Gcls`, `Angl` UntF #Ang, `Type` enum
  `GrdT`, `noisePreSeed` long, `Grad` object class `Grdn` name "Gradient":
  the same Grad shape the layer-style parser (`parse_gradient`) reads (Nm,
  GrdF=CstS, Intr doub 4096, Clrs list of Clrt, Trns list of TrnS).
- `PtFl`: `Ptrn` object {`Nm  ` TEXT, `Idnt` TEXT guid}; scale/phase omitted
  at defaults. Pattern tiles ride the document-global `Patt` block.

### vstk (stroke)

u32 descriptorVersion 16 + descriptor class `strokeStyle`, 16 items in this
exact order (PS-canonical): strokeStyleVersion (long 2), strokeEnabled,
fillEnabled, strokeStyleLineWidth (#Pxl), strokeStyleLineDashOffset (#Pnt),
strokeStyleMiterLimit (doub 100), strokeStyleLineCapType,
strokeStyleLineJoinType, strokeStyleLineAlignment (Butt/Round/Square,
Miter/Round/Bevel, Inside/Center/Outside enums), strokeStyleScaleLock,
strokeStyleStrokeAdjust, strokeStyleLineDashSet (VlLs of UntF `#Nne`; dash
lengths in stroke-width multiples), strokeStyleBlendMode (enum `BlnM` as
FULL stringID "normal"), strokeStyleOpacity (#Prc), strokeStyleContent
(Objc solidColorLayer/gradientLayer/patternLayer, same shapes as the fill
content blocks), strokeStyleResolution (doub 72; converts point-based
widths). Full enum spellings in src/psd/psd_vector.cpp.

### vogk (vector origination / live shapes)

u32 version 1 + u32 descriptorVersion 16 + descriptor class `null` holding
`keyDescriptorList` (VlLs), one entry per live subpath group. Entry items in
captured order (kind-dependent):

- Rect (keyOriginType 1): keyOriginType, keyOriginResolution,
  keyOriginShapeBBox (unitValueQuadVersion 1 + Top/Left/Btom/Rght UntF
  #Pxl), keyOriginBoxCorners (rectangleCornerA..D points), Trnf (xx,xy,yx,
  yy,tx,ty doubles), keyOriginIndex.
- Rounded rect (type 2): the rect set plus keyOriginRRectRadii
  {unitValueQuadVersion, **topRight, topLeft, bottomLeft, bottomRight** UntF
  #Pxl; note the order} inserted after keyOriginResolution.
- Ellipse (type 5): the rect set minus keyOriginBoxCorners.
- Line (type 4): keyOriginType, keyOriginResolution, keyOriginShapeBBox,
  Trnf, keyOriginLineEnd, keyOriginLineStart, keyOriginLineWeight,
  keyOriginLineArrowSt/ArrowEnd, keyOriginLineArrWdth/ArrLngth,
  keyOriginLineArrConc, keyOriginLineWidthArrowUnitPixels/
  LengthArrowUnitPixels, keyOriginBoxCorners, keyOriginIndex. Arrow keys
  come from the plain line's defaults (not COM-authored); Patchy-authored
  arrows were verified by reopening in PS.
- App-level (`executeActionGet`) path-drawn subpaths report keyActionMode
  entries instead of live-shape data.

Live-shape knot constructions (kappa handles, corner orders):
src/core/vector_live_shapes.hpp.

### GdFl gradient fill geometry (calibrated July 2026, probe5c/5d/5e)

- Linear span = the CENTER CHORD of the aligned bounds:
  min(w/|cos a|, h/|sin a|), centered on the bounds center (measured within
  0.5 px at angles 0/20/37/60/75/90). Layer-style overlays deliberately keep
  their corner-to-corner projection (GradientSpanBasis::LayerProjection);
  the two agree at exact axis angles.
- Classic easing applies even to TWO-stop ramps: per-segment catmull-rom
  with duplicated virtual endpoints (f(t) = 0.5t + 1.5t^2 - t^3 for a plain
  2-stop ramp), scaled by smoothness/4096. The OPACITY ramp eases
  identically. Midpoints are the piecewise-linear law through
  (midpoint, 50%) and apply BEFORE the ease.
- gradient_color/gradient_stop_opacity expose this via the
  endpoint_smoothing flag; the vector fill painter passes it, layer styles
  keep their default.

### Stroke rasterization (winding, lattice, bounds)

- Aligned dashes retain original-width caps; zero-length dots carry their path
  tangent. Geometry, tests and residuals: [vector-fixtures.md](vector-fixtures.md).
- The stroker builds the band as a union of per-segment quads plus join/cap
  wedges under the nonzero rule; every loop must carry the SAME orientation
  (append_outline_loop normalizes by signed area), or an opposite-winding
  wedge cancels the quads it overlaps
  (stroke_arc_band_has_no_winding_notches).
- subpath_polyline snaps every vertex (anchors included) to the flattener's
  1/256 lattice so sub-quantum micro-segments cannot seed miter spikes
  (limit 100 admits turns to 178.85 degrees). The coverage band is sized
  from the emitted outline's true hull; stroke curves flatten through the
  same adaptive flatten_cubic as fills. Pinned by
  stroke_bezier_circle_is_translation_stable,
  stroke_miter_spike_stays_in_bounds,
  stroke_curve_is_insensitive_to_sub_quantum_anchor_jitter, stroke golden 3.
- Known gap: whether PS reads `strokeStyleMiterLimit` 100 as an SVG-style
  ratio (Patchy's reading; a bare doub, not #Prc) or a percentage; settle
  with a COM probe of an acute mitered corner at limit 100 vs 4.

### Interior effects vs the vector stroke

Overlays cover the fill plane only and the vector stroke composites above
them; the calibration and renderer notes live in
[layer-effects-render.md](layer-effects-render.md).

PS's baked derived plane (mask flags bit 3) holds UNFEATHERED path
coverage; the feather applies at render. Patchy bakes its own feathered
cache: the raster mask's gaussian (mask_feather_blur) but NOT canvas-clamped:
a path ending on the canvas edge fades there (photoshop-vector-mask-feather.psd).

### Vector masks on layers (mask data section, channels)

- Vector-mask-ONLY layer: no mask section or channel.
- Raster + vector masks: the 20-byte section holds the raster mask
  (channel -2); the vector mask stays in vmsk.
- A SHAPE layer's own path carries the same parameters
  (photoshop-shape-feather.psd, PS 27.9): section flags 0x18, derived plane =
  plain path coverage (hull +-1), and only the SET parameter bits (feather
  alone 27 -> 28 bytes padded, density alone 20). Model:
  `VectorShapeContent::feather/density` (reader drops the derived plane).
  Render (BMP-pinned): feather blurs the WHOLE rendered shape, stroke
  included, unclamped at the canvas (`feather_shape_raster`); density shows
  the fill everywhere at (255 - density)/255 (`apply_shape_density`).
- Density/feather use the parameters form: section flags bit 4, then a
  parameter flags byte (bit 0 user density u8, bit 1 user feather f64, bit 2
  vector density u8 raw, bit 3 vector feather f64 BE), values in that order.
  With a vector parameter set PS ALSO bakes a derived plane into -2
  (section flags bit 3, section rect = baked rect).
- Raster + PARAMETERIZED vector mask (photoshop-both-masks-params.psd):
  a 48-byte section. -2 is PS's COMBINED render (flags 0x18); the
  painted mask is channel -3, sized by the real-user-mask fields (flags u8,
  default u8, rect), which sit BEFORE the parameter byte (Adobe's spec says
  after). Patchy loads -3 as the mask and drops -2. Real
  fields need bit 3 or no bit 4 (PS reads Patchy's 40-byte painted
  all-four form parameters-first).
- Raster-mask density/feather (photoshop-user-mask-params.psd): PS sets bits
  0/1 singly, pads the section to a multiple of 4, keeps -2 the PAINTED
  plane. Both apply at render (LayerMask::density/feather): density as the
  vector mask's; feather = gaussian sigma = feather px
  (feathered_layer_mask), edge-clamped at the canvas (feather_canvas).
- Zero-area -2/-3 raster masks remain empty gray8 LayerMasks; default color
  supplies coverage everywhere. Never substitute derived vector coverage.
  Save the mask record and empty raw -2 channel on pixel, shape, adjustment,
  and group layers, retaining bounds, density, feather and disabled/link
  state. Tests: `psd_empty_user_masks_*`, `psd_empty_real_user_mask_*`,
  `psd_testy_legacy_fills_and_masks_round_trip_if_available`.
- COM gotchas: vectorMaskFeather/Density setd needs the vector mask path
  selected first; feather needs its OWN setd call.

### Document path image resources and PSB

Resource-id constants live in src/core/document_path.hpp.

- Saved paths: resources 2000..2997, resource NAME = path name, payload =
  raw 26-byte record stream (selector 6, selector 8, then subpaths; the vmsk
  grammar WITHOUT the version/flags header).
- Work path: resource 1025, same payload, no name.
- Clipping path selector: resource 2999: pascal path name (even-padded) +
  4 zero bytes + 0x01 (trailing bytes recorded verbatim; re-emit as
  captured).
- PS re-sorts/upserts these like any resource; Patchy preserves unknown ones
  wholesale.
- PSB: all vector keys use the 8BIM signature + 4-byte length form (none are
  in the 8-byte LARGE_KEYS set). Fixture: photoshop-shape.psb.

expired ~2021-2024); boolean path combines, even-odd/nonzero fills, stroke
dashing, caps/joins (decades-old techniques); selection-to-path conversion
via boundary tracing, Douglas-Peucker (1973), and Schneider cubic fitting
(1990; shipped in Photoshop 3, 1994).

Excluded pending their own review (do NOT build without a new patent
check):

- Curvature Pen tool (2018+) and any auto-fitting curve-through-points UX.
- Edge-magnetic vector snapping. (Image tracing itself was cleared with
  boundaries on 2026-08-23: docs/image-trace.md and the "Vector tracing"
  bullet in docs/legal-constraints.md.)
- Snap-to-pixel "align edges" automatic pixel-grid fitting of vector renders
  (plain user-invoked grid/guide snapping of anchors is fine).
- On-canvas live-shape gizmo widgets (in-canvas radius handles etc.);
  options-bar/dialog parameter editing is the cleared route (Apple
  US 8971623; docs/patent-research.md).
- Variable-width strokes / art brushes on paths (out of scope).

Method rules (as for all PSD work): ground truth is licensed Photoshop's
observed output via COM byte-diffing; no Adobe specification text in the
repo; self-authored fixtures only; referential "compatible with Adobe
Photoshop" phrasing; original tool icons with non-Photoshop geometry.
