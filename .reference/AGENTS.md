# Repository Instructions

Repository-wide policy: read before any project action at task start. Reread only if the repository or this file changes, or these instructions leave context.

If `agents_local.md` exists at the repository root, open and read it too. It holds knowledge specific to this checkout and developer, such as which systems it can ssh into and use for building. Anything sensitive goes in `agents_secret.md` beside it, read only if it exists and only when a task needs it. Both are optional and gitignored, and must never be checked in. When neither exists, carry on without them; their absence is not an error. This repository is public, so machine names, users, addresses, local paths, and credentials belong in those files, never in tracked files. A git worktree has no untracked files: look for them in the main checkout, the parent of `git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir`.

Keep this file at or below 30,000 bytes. Detailed implementation knowledge belongs in `docs/<topic>.md`; read the relevant linked document before working in that area, update it when behavior changes, and do not duplicate its details here. Every file under `docs/` must also stay at or below 30,000 bytes (Seth, August 2026): keep docs dense and current-state only. Cut narrative history, experiment logs, and restatements of constants that live in code; never cut normative rules, calibration facts recorded only in the doc, or headings cited from code comments.

## Repository-wide rules

- Every PSD/PSB Patchy writes, including script and MCP output, must open in Adobe Photoshop without warnings or errors. Custom metadata is allowed only when Photoshop accepts the file without warning, repair, or data-discard prompts. Follow the compatibility contract in [docs/ps-compat.md](docs/ps-compat.md).
- When adding or changing user-facing text, make it extractable (`tr()`, a literal-context `translate`, `QT_TR_NOOP`/`QT_TRANSLATE_NOOP` for bound text, `PATCHY_TRANSLATE_NOOP` in Qt-free code), run `scripts\update-translations.ps1`, and fill the new entries in every `translations/patchy_<code>.ts` in the same change. Never hand-edit catalog structure. The catalog tests fail otherwise. See [docs/localization.md](docs/localization.md).
- Tests that need files outside the project must first copy them into `local-test-fixtures`; never add hardcoded external paths such as `C:\temp` or `D:\projects` to test code.
- Commit automatically only after a finished piece of work is verified and its required handoff is complete. Do not commit failing or half-finished states. Never push unless Seth explicitly asks in the current request. Asking to do or continue a release covers build and test only: stop for an explicit go-ahead before any upload, push, publish, or update announcement.
- Never post, reply, or comment on GitHub issues, pull requests, or discussions unless the user explicitly asks in the current request; offer a draft reply instead.
- Never add AI attribution, generated-with text, or an OpenAI/Codex/Claude co-author to commits or pull requests. Keep commit messages to a concise subject and at most one short supporting line. Cite issues as `#NN` (GitHub links it); `Fixes #NN` also closes the issue once it reaches main, so use it only for a complete fix.
- Automation confined to Patchy is authorized: scripted clicks, typing, and direct captures of its windows and hosted plug-in windows (including KPT) need no additional permission. Desktop screenshots (even cropped afterward), global mouse/keyboard input (`SendInput`), Computer Use, and control of other apps require explicit authorization in the current request. Adobe Photoshop COM (`DoJavaScript`, Action Manager) remains always authorized for capture, verification, and acceptance. Use task-owned instances for unattended work; protect unsaved documents and unrelated processes. See [docs/testing.md](docs/testing.md).
- Build/test housekeeping needs no further confirmation: create, rename, replace, or delete generated build artifacts, temporary executable backups, test-owned socket files, logs, and scratch files inside this repository's build or test-output directories after verifying exact paths and ownership, including an obsolete executable kept under a temporary name. Stopping processes launched for the current run is authorized. This does not cover user documents, fixtures, source files, unrelated files/processes, or a running user app/connector.
- `rm` only a full literal path checked to be non-blank, never variable-built or relative. Stop processes by PID, not name.
- Supported Windows, macOS, and Linux Debug and Release builds must have zero compiler, linker, and `lrelease` warnings. Keep warnings non-fatal. Fix Patchy-owned code explicitly. For vendored sources compiled into Patchy-owned targets, scope a suppression to one source and diagnostic. See [docs/platform.md](docs/platform.md).
- User-facing documentation must not use em dashes. Write plain, direct prose without hype, emoji headings, "not just X, but Y" constructions, or stock AI phrasing such as "seamlessly", "robust", "comprehensive", and "delve".
- When a test needs a capability Patchy lacks (an assertion surface, a file or state probe, a way to drive a flow without the desktop UI), prefer adding it to the JavaScript scripting API as a documented first-class `patchy.*` function over a test-only hook: the scripting system improves, and the same test can drive the real build through `--run-script`. Follow the API rules in [docs/scripting.md](docs/scripting.md) (d.ts, guide, change log, permanent identifiers).
- When wasm work is finished, stop every local wasm server you started (`powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\wasm\free-server-port.ps1 -Port <port>` for each port used). Seth restarts one himself when he wants it.

The release process, including version bumps, README author crediting, batch-file order, the GitHub Releases publish (GitHub is the canonical download, rtsoft.com the mirror), and mandatory `NO_PAUSE=1` for non-interactive runs, lives in [docs/release-process.md](docs/release-process.md). Read it in full before bumping a version or running a release batch file.

## Build, test, and release handoff

For code changes, ALWAYS finish work in this repository by refreshing the local release build - `build\release\patchy.exe` must be freshly built from the final working tree at handoff, never stale. If the change is documentation-only or otherwise cannot affect compiled/runtime behavior, do not run the full release build/test handoff; report that it was skipped because the change is non-code.

Required release handoff steps:

1. Build the release preset:

   ```powershell
   cmd /s /c 'scripts\vs-env.bat -arch=x64 -host_arch=x64 >nul && scripts\run-throttled.bat "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\18\Community\Common7\IDE\CommonExtensions\Microsoft\CMake\CMake\bin\cmake.exe" --build --preset release -j 20'
   ```

   The throttling is mandatory: `-j 20` caps ninja for local Windows builds (its default of every core plus two makes this 24-core machine unresponsive; remote builds use every core but four) and `scripts\run-throttled.bat` runs the build at below-normal priority. Run the test binaries through the same helper. Never launch an unthrottled build or substitute a bare `start "" /b /wait /belownormal`: it reports 0 whenever the program launched, while `run-throttled.bat` propagates the child's real exit code, crash codes included. Batch files go through the helper as-is: it wraps `.bat`/`.cmd` in `cmd /c`, because `start` runs a bare batch file under `cmd /K`, which parks at an interactive prompt and reports a failed build as exit 0 (the September 25, 2026 two-hour RETRO hang).

   Run this from the repository root in PowerShell or a real cmd prompt, never Git Bash or another POSIX shell (nested quoting collapses there and cmd exits 0 without building). Trust the build only if the log shows compile/link lines or `ninja: no work to do`, never the exit code alone. Builds that include an app target never end at `ninja: no work to do`: every build rewrites the generated build-stamp header (`cmake/write_build_stamp.cmake`), recompiles `build_info.cpp`, and relinks, so the in-app build date always matches the build that produced the binary. The version number follows the same pattern (`cmake/patchy_version.hpp.in` becomes the generated `patchy_version.hpp`, included only where the version is shown or compared): never reintroduce it as a target-wide compile definition, which makes every version bump recompile all of `patchy_ui`.

   `scripts\vs-env.bat` is the one place that knows where VsDevCmd.bat lives; call it instead of VsDevCmd directly so every build gets the same environment without the spurious `'vswhere.exe' is not recognized` line. See [docs/release-process.md](docs/release-process.md).

   CMakeLists.txt owns the MSVC Release codegen flags (`/Zi /GL` on compiles, `/DEBUG:FULL /INCREMENTAL:NO /LTCG` on links), so every configure emits `patchy.pdb` (for symbolizing WER dumps from `%LOCALAPPDATA%\CrashDumps`) and link-time optimized binaries. Never hand-edit `build\release\CMakeCache.txt`. To symbolize a dump from an older build, rebuild that commit in a temporary worktree; full links reproduce the binary layout.

   A git worktree has no `.deps`: configure its release preset once with `--preset release -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<main-checkout>/.deps/Qt/6.8.3/msvc2022_64` (the main checkout's Qt; `agents_local.md` has the path); the build command is unchanged.

   A running `build\release\patchy.exe` or `patchy-mcp.exe` does not block the link: each target's PRE_LINK step (`cmake/unlock_locked_executable.cmake`) renames the locked image aside as `<name>.stale-<stamp>.exe`, the running instance keeps working from the renamed file, and the link writes a fresh one. Never kill either process (Seth may have unsaved work) and never package a `.stale-` file. Batch files must compare exit codes against 0, never `if errorlevel 1`: a failed link makes `cmake --build` exit negative, which that test ignores. See [docs/release-process.md](docs/release-process.md).

2. Run release test binaries from `build\release`, scoped to the change:

   ```powershell
   cmd /s /c 'cd /d build\release && ..\..\scripts\run-throttled.bat .\patchy_core_tests.exe'
   $env:QT_QPA_PLATFORM='offscreen'; cmd /s /c 'cd /d build\release && ..\..\scripts\run-throttled.bat .\patchy_ui_visual_tests.exe'
   ```

   - **Per-change verification runs only the tests the change could possibly affect**. Both binaries accept a name-substring filter as the first argument; the UI suite also reads `PATCHY_UI_TEST_FILTER`. Pick filters that cover the feature, the changed tests, and any shared code the change touches, and report the filters used. Do not run a full suite "to be safe" for a localized change: a new dialog, menu item, or script API needs its own tests plus the theme-token and hotkey checks, not the whole UI suite.
   - Widen to the full core suite only when the change reaches core-wide surfaces: `src/core`, shared helpers (`main_window_shared`, `canvas_widget_shared`, `psd_io_common`), PSD or other serialization, byte-pinned/canary paths, or refactors and file moves whose blast radius cannot be filtered.
   - Widen to the full UI visual suite only for changes that can affect rendering or UI behavior application-wide: compositing/rendering, application-wide QSS/theme or hotkeys, or the visual test harness itself. Never run it for build-system or other non-rendering changes.
   - **A real release (preparing release builds for final packaging and upload) always runs both full suites.** Filtered runs miss ordered cross-test state such as QSettings and artifact dependencies, so that is the one time the whole suite is mandatory.
   - **Judge a suite by its `[FAIL]` lines as well as its exit code.** Both are trustworthy through `run-throttled.bat`; a bare `start "" /b /wait /belownormal` reports every failure as exit 0 (see step 1).

3. Explicitly report whether `build\release\patchy.exe` exists.

4. Changes to platform-guarded code, CMake files/presets, or packaging also require the affected best-effort remote build: `scripts\remote\remote-build.ps1 -Target mac` and/or `-Target linux`. Report failures even though Windows remains the release gate. Separately, when Seth explicitly asks to offload a Windows build because the dev box is busy, `-Target windows` builds the real `release` preset on the Windows offload host; the local `build\release` remains the release gate and packaging source. See [docs/platform.md](docs/platform.md).

Do not say a release was created unless the release preset build succeeded.

## Universal engineering invariants

- **Never read a variable in the same call that moves it.** C++ argument evaluation order is unspecified and MSVC evaluates right-to-left in relevant cases. Compute the read result first, then call with that local and `std::move(value)`. `CanvasWidget::combine_selection_from_mask(bounds, mask)` also provides an overload that derives the value safely.
- **Read revision-bearing objects through const access.** Mutable Layer accessors bump revisions on access, invalidating revision-keyed caches. Use `std::as_const` or another const path. `PATCHY_REV_TRACE=1` traces bumps. See [docs/performance.md](docs/performance.md).
- **Nothing proportional to all layer pixels may run per repaint.** Cache or bound work reachable from `paintEvent`; use content revision for whole-render results and `pixel_revision()` for pixel-buffer-only results. See [docs/performance.md](docs/performance.md).
- **Core algorithms must be deterministic across toolchains.** Use splitmix64 with explicit uniform mapping, never `std::uniform_*_distribution`. Use integer math or deterministic-double envelopes with fixed tie-breaks for geometry and graph algorithms.
- **Persisted identifiers never change.** Hotkey command ids, preset ids, stress-test step ids, New Document preset ids, script/API identifiers, settings keys, file-format tokens (the `.patchytheme` keys and `preferences/customThemeId` included; see [docs/theme-files.md](docs/theme-files.md)), and the organization name that keys the per-user app-data folder (see [docs/fonts.md](docs/fonts.md)) are compatibility contracts. `BlendMode` and `BrushDynamicControl` are append-only enums.
- **No hardcoded chrome colors in `src/ui`.** Every UI color is a named role in `src/ui/theme_palette.hpp`, written as an `@role_name` token in QSS or read through `theme()` when painted. See the color-scheme section of [docs/ui-conventions.md](docs/ui-conventions.md) for what is deliberately exempt (the transparency checkerboard, marching ants, tool cursors, user grid/guide colors).
- **Byte-stability canaries change only deliberately.** `psd_layered_writer_bytes_are_stable`, `gif_encoder_bytes_are_stable`, and `tool_write_paths_digest_baseline` pin default output. Never re-pin them to make a refactor pass.
- **The CPU compositor is the reference renderer.** GPU and optimized paths must match its pinned output.
- **File paths cross the Qt boundary as UTF-16, never as `std::string`.** `QString::toStdString()` is UTF-8 and MSVC's `std::filesystem::path(std::string)` decodes it with the ANSI code page, which mangles non-ASCII names. Convert with `to_filesystem_path`/`to_qstring` from `src/ui/qt_paths.hpp` (never `toStdWString`), and turn path pieces into UTF-8 text with `path_to_utf8` from `src/support/path_utils.hpp`, never `path::string()`. Every new file-reading or file-writing entry point gets a Unicode-path test built on `tests/unicode_path_names.hpp`. See [docs/platform.md](docs/platform.md).
- **Never truncate a user's file in place.** Every document writer goes through `write_file_bytes_atomically` (src/support/atomic_file_write.hpp) or `QSaveFile`: a sibling temporary file and a replace-existing rename, so a crash or a full disk mid-save leaves the old file intact. See [docs/document-recovery.md](docs/document-recovery.md).
- **Serialization is fixed-width and cross-platform.** Never write `size_t`, `long`, `wchar_t`, native structs, or host-endian values into a file format. PSD I/O uses explicit big-endian primitives. See [docs/platform.md](docs/platform.md) and the relevant format document.
- **A font face's natural width is `QFont::AnyStretch`, never `setStretch(100)`.** Qt synthesizes request / face width class, so stretch 100 on a Condensed face is a 133 percent stretch; a reference measured that way stretched an unstretched line by a third (September 2026). See [docs/text-tool.md](docs/text-tool.md).
- **Detach copy-on-write pixel storage on the launching thread before a parallel write.** `PixelBuffer` shares its bytes across copies (undo snapshots, render snapshots, `Document` copies) until the first non-const access. Worker strips that call non-const `row()`/`pixel()`/`data()` on a still-shared buffer race to detach: each copies the bytes while another strip's replacement frees them (access violations inside the copy, or heap corruption long after; the September 2026 Remove Object crash). Call `pixels.data()` once on the launching thread and hand the workers spans or raw pointers; `apply_row_spans_in_parallel` (src/ui/filter_workflows.cpp) and `heal_mask_from_surroundings` are the references.

## Cross-cutting implementation rules

- Runtime assets are shared copy-once CMake targets. New executables use existing `patchy_copy_*` helpers; never add per-target POST_BUILD copies into the shared output directory. See [docs/code-organization.md](docs/code-organization.md).
- Session data must outlive canvas event delivery. Preserve MainWindow's canvas-detach and session-close destruction orders; references into `SmartObjectStore` do not survive `add_embedded`. See [docs/code-organization.md](docs/code-organization.md).
- Every submenu action under the menubar gets `QAction::NoRole`: on macOS Qt merges items by translated title ("Ajustes", "Réglages") into the app menu and a merged submenu crashes on the next window activation (GitHub issue 29). See [docs/platform.md](docs/platform.md).
- Read modifier state folded from the current event, not `QApplication::keyboardModifiers()`. See [docs/ui-conventions.md](docs/ui-conventions.md) and [docs/testing.md](docs/testing.md).
- New non-modal dialogs use `run_non_modal_dialog`; closing-sensitive dialogs funnel through `done()`. See [docs/ui-conventions.md](docs/ui-conventions.md).
- Open-dialog filter strings have a Windows/Qt-specific duplicated-pattern contract. Read [docs/file-formats.md](docs/file-formats.md) before changing them.
- The local PSBtest tent and Content fixtures must never be overwritten. See [docs/smart-objects.md](docs/smart-objects.md).
- Offscreen text on Windows is FreeType; a real window is DirectWrite, which ignores a QFont stretch for glyph images. Text pins pass offscreen and can still be wrong on screen; see the font-engine note in [docs/testing.md](docs/testing.md).
- Photoshop reads a document's text fonts and content from its own `Txt2` block, not the layers, and trusts it over the TySh. Patchy rebuilds that block on every save (an authored object per regenerated type layer, untouched objects kept, no layout caches); a new TySh key needs its Txt2 twin in `psd_text_engine_block.cpp` or Photoshop shows the stale object. Format, key map and what Photoshop accepts: [docs/txt2.md](docs/txt2.md); see also [docs/ps-compat.md](docs/ps-compat.md).
- Every gradient descriptor Patchy writes carries at least two transparency stops, and a file that already has none heals on save. An empty `Trns` list makes Photoshop discard the layer behind its "unknown data" prompt; `scripts\dev\photoshop-open-check.ps1` detects that prompt per file. See [docs/ps-compat.md](docs/ps-compat.md).
- Never leave a Qt host lookup pending at quit. `QNetworkAccessManager` resolves through `QHostInfo`'s thread pool, and `~QCoreApplication` waits for that pool with no timeout, so a `getaddrinfo` stalled by dropped DNS froze macOS quits for 20 to 30 s (GitHub issue 48). `update_checker.cpp` resolves the host on a detached thread first; any new network client does the same (`PATCHY_UPDATE_MANIFEST_URL` reproduces it; see docs/testing.md). The tracked-worker wait after `app.exec()` is bounded too (`finish_after_event_loop`): a worker still blocked after 10 s ends the process without destructors after dropping the recovery folder, so never rely on a destructor for anything the user could lose.
- Agent tooling: the Claude Code Bash tool rewrites backslash escapes inside heredocs. Write any content with backslashes through the file-writing tool and run it from disk.
