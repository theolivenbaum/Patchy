### Linux

Paste this into a terminal. It installs Patchy for your user from the Patchy Flatpak
repository and pulls the shared KDE runtime from Flathub. No root needed.

```sh
flatpak install --user -y https://rtsoft.com/flatpak/com.rtsoft.patchy.flatpakref
```

Patchy then updates with `flatpak update` or through your software center, and starts
from your application menu or with `flatpak run com.rtsoft.patchy`.

This needs the `flatpak` tool. If needed, install it first with
`sudo apt install flatpak`.

The `.flatpakref` link in the table downloads a small file that a Flatpak-aware
software center (GNOME Software, KDE Discover) can open to install Patchy. Ubuntu has
none by default, and on Ubuntu 24.04 GNOME Software's Open button fails to start
Flatpak apps, so use the terminal command above instead.

The single-file bundle is the same build, for when you would rather download a file
first. Install it with `flatpak install --user -y PatchyLinux.flatpak`. It still fetches
the KDE runtime from Flathub, and it updates from the same repository afterwards.

My flatpak knowledge is limited, so I hope all this makes sense.  I hope to submit Patchy to Flathub eventually, but for now we have our own repository.

[Full feature list and format support](docs/features.md) · [Scripting guide](scripts/bundled/scripting-guide.md) · [AI control setup](docs/ai-control.md)

**Local by design.** No telemetry, tracking, or uploads of your images. The browser build
runs the same editor locally through WebAssembly. Desktop builds have more memory
available and add printing, scanner/camera import, and command-line automation.
Optional update checks contact GitHub. Twelve interface languages, dark and light
schemes, and importable themes are included.

## PSD compatibility, measured

In the [October 6, 2026 Testy v2 run](https://www.rtsoft.com/testy/2026-10-06/),
Patchy opened **all 309 files** of the psd-tools test collection, and Photoshop
reopened **every Patchy save** with **all 43 text objects, 183 adjustment layers,
172 Smart Objects, and 181 live effects** kept. Patchy's perceptual render match
was **89.8%**, the highest of the seven programs tested against Photoshop's
reference, using commit `57ba855c`.

Testy v2 scores each program on what it draws itself: the baked pixels Photoshop
stores for text, shapes, fills, and Smart Objects are removed first. That is
stricter than the August run, so the two sets of numbers are not comparable.

These are dated, corpus-specific results. The linked report has every file's
renders and difference maps for all eight columns. Read the
[full comparison and methodology](docs/psd-compatibility-benchmark.md) for the
tables, per-folder results, scoring rules, and limitations.

**Know the limits:** editing is RGB/RGBA 8-bit; there is no GPU acceleration or
CMYK/Lab/16-bit/32-bit editing. Unsupported Smart Filters can remain preview-locked,
and Affinity import has format-specific limitations. See [current compatibility](docs/features.md#current-status).

## What's New

### 1.06 - October 6, 2026

- Crop tool: it frames the canvas when selected, adopts the current selection, and has a Style menu with a Size mode for typing an exact Width and Height. Alt resizes the box about its center and Space slides it during a handle drag ([issue 66](https://github.com/SethRobinson/Patchy/issues/66))
- Move tool: Alt-drag duplicates the layer, Ctrl+click selects the layer under the pointer, the Auto-Select setting is remembered, and artwork on the pasteboard can be outlined and grabbed ([issue 69](https://github.com/SethRobinson/Patchy/issues/69), [issue 73](https://github.com/SethRobinson/Patchy/issues/73))
- Zoom In/Out and Zoom tool clicks step along Photoshop's zoom levels, and 100% is one document pixel per screen pixel on scaled displays ([issue 77](https://github.com/SethRobinson/Patchy/issues/77), [issue 75](https://github.com/SethRobinson/Patchy/issues/75))
- Changing the foreground color or picking with the Eyedropper recolors the selected shape ([issue 67](https://github.com/SethRobinson/Patchy/issues/67))
- Text: the keypad Enter key commits the text and a triple click selects a line ([issue 71](https://github.com/SethRobinson/Patchy/issues/71), [issue 74](https://github.com/SethRobinson/Patchy/issues/74))
- Closing a modified document offers Save, Don't Save, and Cancel ([issue 70](https://github.com/SethRobinson/Patchy/issues/70)), the color picker opens with the hex field selected ([issue 68](https://github.com/SethRobinson/Patchy/issues/68)), options-bar labels are plain text instead of chips ([issue 76](https://github.com/SethRobinson/Patchy/issues/76)), and double-clicking a New Document preset creates the document
- PSD compatibility: Bitmap, Indexed, Duotone, Lab and Multichannel PSDs open by converting to RGB, adjustment layers in CMYK and grayscale documents apply to their own channels, and the Exposure adjustment layer is supported. Stroke effects on semi-transparent content, group Fill opacity, noise gradient fills, Divide, Levels and Posterize are closer to Photoshop ([issue 65](https://github.com/SethRobinson/Patchy/issues/65))
- Selection Feather and Anti-alias are kept per tool and remembered between sessions ([issue 64](https://github.com/SethRobinson/Patchy/issues/64))
- Layers above a layer being transformed stay visible during the drag ([issue 72](https://github.com/SethRobinson/Patchy/issues/72)), and clicking a blank area of the Layers panel deselects every layer
- Scripting: `layer.rerenderText()` and `layer.rerenderSmartObject()`
  
- Testy V2 written, it's a more accurate way to test PSD compatibilty of various apps,, it's a WIP but you can see a run [here](https://www.rtsoft.com/testy/2026-10-06/).  

- I added some people to the credits (Kevdoy had a TON of bug reports today), thanks folks!)  But then the credits got too big, so I moved them to the Help->About screen as being on the main screen actually hurt the real-estate needed to show more recent files.  If anybody is like "no, don't put me in the credits, jerk" just let me know.
### 1.05 - October 4, 2026

- Linux: Patchy now updates through `flatpak update` and the software center, from a signed Flatpak repository ([issue 28](https://github.com/SethRobinson/Patchy/issues/28)). The Flatpak moved to the current KDE runtime, and iPhone HEIC photos open without installing an extra codec package
- Open from Clipboard: File > Open from Clipboard (Ctrl+Alt+Shift+N) opens the copied image as a new document
- Clicking a palette swatch recolors the selected text and shape layers ([issue 61](https://github.com/SethRobinson/Patchy/issues/61))
- Type tool: pressing on a text layer and dragging selects text in one gesture, without a second click to enter editing first
- Windows installer: Patchy now appears under Explorer's "Open with" for the image types it opens, without changing any default program
- Fixed a freeze on KDE when a drag crossed the layer action buttons ([issue 62](https://github.com/SethRobinson/Patchy/issues/62))

[Older releases](RELEASE-HISTORY.md)

## Photoshop plug-ins (.8bf, Windows only)

Choose **Plugins > Open Plug-ins Folder**, copy your `.8bf` files and their supporting
files into it, then choose **Plugins > Rescan Plug-in Folders**. Both 32-bit and 64-bit
filters appear under **Plugins > Legacy Photoshop Plug-ins**.

Filters run on the active pixel layer, respect the selection, and apply as one undoable
step. A separate helper isolates plug-in crashes. Plug-ins still run with your user
permissions, so install only ones you trust. KPT and other formerly full-screen filters
get a bounded, movable window. [Plug-in details](docs/plugins.md).

## AI Disclosure

This project was developed with significant assistance from AI tools.  I mean, you can still blame me (Seth) for bugs, but I just wanted to mention it.

Note:  All included textures/materials are real images taken by humans, not AI generated

## Missing features / contributions?

AI has reached the point where you can use your favorite AI agent to add the missing feature you want.

Just give it the link to this repo and tell it "read AGENTS.md and add feature X to this project".  It will read the code, read the tests, and add the feature.

I mean, that's kind the power of open source, amplified.

Whatever AI you use (the smarter the better), tell it (or more likely, it's reading this right now) to read AGENTS.md before doing anything else. It contains the build and repository-wide rules, then routes feature work to the relevant document under `docs/`.

There are 2600+ regression and benchmarking tests. AGENTS.md links agents to the testing guide that explains how to select and run them.  Due to the size of some of the test files I use they aren't all included, it will skip tests that require missing files.\
\
I probably don't want any major features coming from outside, as there are wrong and right ways to do things, some of it a bit subjective. Remember, you can always go crazy in your own fork, have some fun!\
\
If you have a bug fix or feature you think fits this project's scope please open an issue or tweet/etc at me.  If you want to submit a pull request, please look at the actual code and fully TEST IT YOURSELF before submitting, and if possible include screenshots of the actual changes so it's clear what you're doing.  If you're using AI, use a good one (Fable/Astra+ class), we don't want barely working slop.

Don't trust AI to create and submit PRs with no oversight, I'll delete ones that have too much AI smell.  Smell human.  This is starting to sound weird but you know what I mean.\
\
Also, note that certain features are crippled or not included due to Adobe patents.  For example, our "quick select" tool doesn't update in realtime, you have to finish the stroke.  We can revisit this around 2030 when the patents expire...
