# Third-Party Notices

Patchy's current Windows release package uses the Qt 6 desktop runtime and
app-local Microsoft Visual C++ runtime DLLs. Planned libraries that are not
linked into the application are intentionally not listed here.

## Qt 6

The Windows application dynamically links Qt 6 modules from the local Qt
installation used for the release build:

- Qt Core
- Qt GUI
- Qt Widgets
- Qt PrintSupport
- Qt SVG
- Qt ImageFormats
- Qt PDF (optional; present when the build's Qt carries the add-on)

Qt PDF bundles a snapshot of PDFium, which is distributed under a BSD 3-Clause
license together with Apache License 2.0 components. Patchy uses it only to
render PDF pages to images when opening a `.pdf` file; PDF writing goes through
Qt GUI's own QPdfWriter and needs no part of it. The full component list and
license text ship in `licenses/qt/qtpdf-<version>.spdx`.

The package also includes the Qt plugins needed by the current app:

- `platforms/qwindows.dll`
- `styles/qmodernwindowsstyle.dll`
- `iconengines/qsvgicon.dll`
- `imageformats/qjpeg.dll`
- `imageformats/qsvg.dll`
- `imageformats/qtiff.dll`
- `imageformats/qwebp.dll`

Qt is available under a commercial Qt license or under open-source licenses.
This local zip uses dynamic Qt DLLs and includes the Qt module SPDX notice files
under `licenses/qt/` so downstream review can see the exact Qt build metadata,
third-party components, and license text extracted by Qt.

## Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime DLLs

The Windows package includes the app-local Microsoft Visual C++ runtime DLLs
from the local Visual Studio redistributable CRT directory. These DLLs are
provided under Microsoft's runtime redistribution terms.

## Noto Naskh Arabic

Patchy includes Noto Naskh Arabic Regular and Bold from the Noto Arabic fonts
project for Photoshop text-layer compatibility. The font files are distributed
under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1; the license text is included at
`fonts/noto_naskh_arabic/OFL.txt` in the release package.

## Bundled fonts (web build only)

The WebAssembly build bundles a set of open fonts under `third_party/fonts-web/`
because a browser exposes no system fonts to the app. Desktop packages do not
include these files. Every family is distributed under the SIL Open Font
License, Version 1.1, and each family directory carries its own license text as
`OFL.txt`, packaged into the web build's preloaded data file. All files are
unmodified static-instance builds fetched from the projects' official
repositories on 2026-07-31 unless noted below:

## miniz

`src/formats/miniz/` vendors miniz 3.0.2 (https://github.com/richgel999/miniz),
the single-source zlib/deflate implementation used by the Aseprite file format's
compressed cels. MIT License; the license text is included at
`src/formats/miniz/LICENSE`.

## stb_image

`src/formats/stb/` vendors stb_image 2.30 (https://github.com/nothings/stb),
compiled decode-only and restricted to JPEG and PNG. It decodes the original
image files that Affinity .af documents embed for placed/opened pictures (the
document stores only a mip pyramid plus the untouched original). stb_image is
dual-licensed MIT / public domain; Patchy uses it under the MIT license,
included at `src/formats/stb/LICENSE`.

## Zstandard

`src/formats/zstd/` vendors the decompression half of Zstandard 1.5.7
(https://github.com/facebook/zstd, Copyright Meta Platforms, Inc. and
affiliates) as the project's generated single-file decoder (`zstddeclib.c`
from `build/single_file_libs`), used to read the compressed streams inside
Affinity .af documents. Zstandard is dual-licensed BSD-3-Clause / GPLv2;
Patchy uses it under the BSD-3-Clause license, included at
`src/formats/zstd/LICENSE`. No compression code is vendored.

## Little CMS

`src/color/lcms2/` vendors the Little CMS 2.17 core library
(https://github.com/mm2/Little-CMS), used to convert CMYK PSD documents through
their embedded ICC color profile on import. Only the MIT-licensed core is
vendored (the optional lcms2 speed plugins are GPL-licensed and are not
included); the license text is included at `src/color/lcms2/LICENSE`.

## libheif (web build only)

`src/formats/libheif/` vendors libheif 1.23.1
(https://github.com/strukturag/libheif), Copyright Dirk Farin and
contributors, under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 3 or later.
The complete LGPL/GPL license text is included at
`src/formats/libheif/COPYING` and is staged with the web application as
`libheif-COPYING.txt`.

Patchy fetched the official `v1.23.1` source archive from
`https://github.com/strukturag/libheif/archive/refs/tags/v1.23.1.zip`. Its
SHA-256 is
`F2303C92396B672D8B1BF8156DC1FC1715CC5D4AE1F147D205EA957DB334B2FA`.
Patchy's local change to `libheif/plugins/decoder_webcodecs.cc` adds runtime
capability/error handling, safe asynchronous input copies, decoder/frame
lifetime cleanup, decoded-buffer bounds checks, and support for odd-sized and
multi-slice images. That modified source is included in this repository.

libheif is linked only into Patchy's WebAssembly browser application as an
HEIF container parser and bridge to the browser's WebCodecs HEVC decoder.
The build disables libde265, x265, FFmpeg, every other software codec backend,
every compressed-codec encoder backend, dynamic plug-in loading, and the
experimental uncompressed codec. Patchy does not distribute an HEVC decoder
or encoder.

Patchy's complete corresponding application source is available under the MIT
License at `https://github.com/SethRobinson/Patchy`. The pinned toolchain,
configuration, and rebuild instructions are in `docs/wasm.md`; they permit a
recipient to replace libheif with a modified interface-compatible version and
relink the WebAssembly application. Release tags identify the source for each
deployed version.

## LibRaw

`src/formats/libraw/` vendors LibRaw 0.22.1 (https://www.libraw.org,
Copyright (C) 2008-2025 LibRaw LLC), the camera raw decoder and develop
pipeline behind opening CR2/CR3/NEF/ARW/RAF/DNG and other camera raw files.
LibRaw is dual-licensed and may be used under either the GNU LGPL 2.1 or the
CDDL 1.0; Patchy uses it under the CDDL 1.0. Only the stock release tarball is
vendored: the separate LibRaw demosaic-pack repositories are GPL-licensed and
are not included. LibRaw itself incorporates code from dcraw (Dave Coffin,
non-restricted portions), the BSD-licensed DCB demosaic and FBDD denoise
(Jacek Gozdz), the BSD-licensed X3F tools (Roland Karlsson), and MIT-licensed
Adobe DNG SDK fragments. The license texts are included at
`src/formats/libraw/LICENSE.CDDL`, `src/formats/libraw/LICENSE.LGPL`, and
`src/formats/libraw/COPYRIGHT`.

## Bundled photo-texture pattern presets (Poly Haven, CC0)

The 20 photo-based pattern presets under the "Textures" folder (embedded as
512x512 PNG tiles in `src/ui/textures/`, ids in `src/core/pattern_presets.cpp`)
are downscaled diffuse maps from Poly Haven (https://polyhaven.com), published
under CC0 ("You can use our assets for any purpose, including commercial work.
You do not need to give credit or attribution"). All are real photo-scanned
surfaces created by named human artists (no AI generation, per
docs/legal-constraints.md); the 1K PNG masters were fetched from dl.polyhaven.org on
2026-07-12 and downscaled losslessly (no JPEG step) with a seam-preserving
3x3-tile filter.

## Built-in color palette presets

The palette presets bundled for the palettized editing mode fall into two
groups. Hardware palettes (NES/2C02, Commodore 64 in Pepto's calibrated
rendering, Game Boy, CGA/EGA, the DOS/VGA mode-13h default DAC table, ZX
Spectrum, MSX/TMS9918, Amstrad CPC) are RGB renderings of hardware color
generation and are factual data, not copyrightable works. Community palettes
are included only where the author allows free use: the PICO-8 palette
(Lexaloffle explicitly permits using the PICO-8 palette in any work),
DawnBringer's DB16/DB32 palettes (published freely by their author on the
Pixelation forums and mirrored on Lospec), and the Dink Smallwood game palette
(RTsoft's own title, included by its author). All preset tables are generated
in code at `src/core/palette_presets.cpp`; no palette files are redistributed.

## Bundled UI themes

The theme files under `themes/bundled/` (compiled into the application through
`src/ui/themes.qrc`) are generated by `scripts/dev/generate-bundled-themes.py`
from Patchy's own Dark palette. Four of them place that palette onto the tone
scales of community color schemes, used under their MIT licenses: Solarized by
Ethan Schoonover, Nord by Sven Greb (Arctic Ice Studio), Dracula by Zeno Rocha,
and Gruvbox by Pavel Pertsev. Only the color values are used; no files, code,
or artwork from those projects are redistributed. Darkest, Medium Gray, and
High Contrast are Patchy's own.

## libwebp 1.6.0 (including SharpYUV)

Animated WebP import/export statically links the codec sources from
https://storage.googleapis.com/downloads.webmproject.org/releases/webp/libwebp-1.6.0.tar.gz
(SHA-256 `e4ab7009bf0629fd11982d4c2aa83964cf244cffba7347ecd39019a9e38c4564`).
Source: `src/formats/libwebp`; Patchy's build prefixes symbols to isolate Qt's codec.
The two namespace-only source changes are documented in `src/formats/libwebp/PATCHY.md`.
The upstream BSD license and additional patent grant follow.

The `test-fixtures/webp` animation and reference PNGs are Patchy-authored geometric
test images, encoded with Pillow/libwebp: three 32 by 24 RGBA frames, 33/67/101 ms,
three total plays, lossless. They exercise partial alpha and offset rectangles.

`test-fixtures/gif/pillow-animated-transparent.gif` is a Patchy-authored geometric
fixture encoded with Pillow: three 32 by 24 transparent frames with red, green and
blue rectangles, delays 100/230/50 ms, disposal to background and infinite looping.
It verifies GIF to lossless WebP to GIF conversion alongside the original GIF fixture.
